weed stands stout
thistles, burr
gadolinum kraut
hummus and herb

ye olden spires arched waxened copper
for le fleur marine, kelpish tide
betty stout, orange'd brass
vermillion mounts gaping maw "nitride"

the rose has thorns wrapped bristled out
the rose knows not its thorns 
the rose tries, again and again
to love those it finds dear

oh lydia, dear lydia
why must you hurt me so
your shadow inhabits my waking hours
sometimes i wonder if i day-dream

i fear i am inferior
to you in many ways
for i have not grasped my strengths (if they exist)
i hate that you made no attempt to try

who am i 
your caretaker? your uneasy partner?
your former lover? a "friend"?
you, whose refracted traumas have been branded onto me
you, who 

i cannot speak
i cannot cry
i cannot live and i cannot die

betwixed the witched of yonder-and-day
your shivers roll down my spine
the anticipation of your love has left a hole in my heart

if we cannot have love we must fight for the future
