> *Ectogenesis* (from the Greek ἐκτός, "outside", and genesis) is the growth of an organism in an artificial environment, outside the body in which it would normally be found, such as the growth of an embryo or fetus outside the mother's body, or the growth of bacteria outside the body of a host. The term was coined by British scientist J. B. S. Haldane in 1924. [Wikipedia]

There are two natural starting points for artificial womb development: making technology that increases the viability of premature fetuses or making technology allowing for embryo development immediately post-fertilization *in vitro*. [Nature recently featured advancements in the former](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms15112), while the Hanna lab has made [stem-cell based embryo models lasting up until 14 days after fertilization](https://www-nature-com.libproxy.berkeley.edu/articles/s41586-023-06604-5).

Regulations restricting this research abound. It's comparatively easy to make the argument for the former line of research: increasing the viability of premature babies is obviously good (to most people), and enables more people who already wanted to be parents to be parents. It reduces the risk of painful miscarriages in the second or third trimester. By contrast, arguing for the second line of research is difficult. It requires experiments on human embryos, and Americans are legally not allowed to experiment on human embryos post 2 weeks after fertilization, nor is the federal government allowed to fund this research.

Why don't we just fund research into primate embryogenesis instead? [Unclear]

Here's an overview of relevant research:
