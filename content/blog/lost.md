- Copper brooch with tardigrade & tesseract engravings. Gifted to me by an eco-technologist acting as an avant-garde musician at an Edge Esmeralda closing event. 500 extant copies: if you own one, I would love to meet you. 
- *Studies in Hegelian Cosmology* by J. M. E. McTaggart. 1903 edition, greenbacked & hardcover & originally archived at Trinity College, Cambridge. "On loan" from the Rhodes Library; saddened by the likely indefinite postponement of return. 
- U.S. Passport. Visas to Turkiye, India. Entry and exit stamps from U.K., Czechia, France, Germany, Switzerland, Japan, Taiwan, India, Turkiye, Poland, Finland, Ireland, Georgia, Ukraine.
- Turkish Antarctic expedition pin, with decorated wooden bird. 17th birthday present from a dear friend of mine.
- Framework laptop, 13". Ran NixOS. Was approaching a faithful representation of my own brain; I lost an extension of myself. 
- Black Leuchtterm notebook. Maths & rambles & private keys. 
- Silver necklace with misshapen star. Acquired in a jewelry store in the Mission, originally intended for my partner. Ultimately not for me.
- Clothes: checkered flannel shirt, also acquired in the Mission. Partner's beanie. Foresight hoodie, MATS jacket. Beloved boots. 
- Bike. Estimated ~$15k new, a kind mechanic gave it to me for free. Was the way I got to school for a while; suspension perfect for mountain biking. Stolen in Healdsburg. 
- Letters. From S to me, written and drawn in Prague on self-Narrativism; from me to S, written in Taiwan as poetry; from R to me, written in print English in the Queen's College; from G to me, first on a pink sticky-note and next on a four-inch thumbpad; so, so many between L and I. ESPR/WARP/Atlas/ASPR/Rise notes. 
- My phone, twice: firstly in Warsaw airport, and secondly in a San Francisco Airbnb. The second was a replacement for the first, however, and I found the first when I went through Warsaw again. Ended up back where I started.
- My glasses.
