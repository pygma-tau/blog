Consider a startup.

Classically, employees at an early-stage startup are not tied to a functional role.  A team of two may band together intending to specialize in their chosen disciplines---Bradley writes code while Jeff handles sales, say---but not often can their work stay siloed. For instance, consumer software products require marathon amounts of time and energy to maintain, and Bradley will spend time answering support tickets just as Jeff will have to learn frontend. 

(It may be that Bradley spends most of his time writing code and Jeff spends most of his time talking to customers!)

Institutions[^1] typically have two symbiotic organizational "modes": 

- "hardware structures:" a university's rulebook, a nation's laws, the Catholic Church's catechism, etcetera. Key is that it's **locally static**, maybe as it's used as a coordination mechanism and changing it is costly, or the institution's purpose is inextricably bound up with it, or it's a fundamental biological property (e.g. in the case of familial bonds). It also helps for it to be **legible**, but this gets thorny when considering institutions with constituents potentially lacking the ability to store and engage with knowledge in the normal sense (T-cells in an immune system).


- "software structures:" Puritanical culture in Jamestown, Massachusetts, the intricacies of Japanese bowing, tacit knowledge shared by a community. Such are not necessarily locally dynamic, but I view software structures as **subjected to selection pressure with rapid feedback loops** (not necessarily with large updates at each $\Delta t$). 

I find this frame helpful because systemic dynamics are often controlled by [1] some background constraints, e.g. legal, that can be "taken as constant" and [2] some naively illegible behavioral interactions that are relatively unmodelable *a priori* (without specific knowledge of the situation). Notably, what gets classed as "hardware" or "software" can change for different timescales or problems! 

Classically, we can take the case of [Venezuela's 1811 Constitution](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constituci%C3%B3n_Federal_de_los_Estados_de_Venezuela_de_1811). It adopted a federalism nearly identical to that of the recently established United States; yet its evolution over the next two hundred years wildly diverged. A common refrain, in this case and other newly independent Latin American colonies which attempted a similar stratagem, is that WASP culture is part-and-parcel of what made America great and it is not easily replicated. Of course, one should be intensely skeptical of macrohistory, but this hypothesis worth considering. 

Another case we can take is that of startups. What exactly is the "startup hardware" in the nucleation phase? 

Universities are a third case.
