January: half-dying, Treehouse started, read Debreu, mild insanity  
February: quarter-dying, started a Nick Land reading group, learned of nonequilibrium QFT and Chewi's stochastic coupling work  
March: 15% dying, Nick Land reading group died, EGA French, Agent Foundations CMU 
April: 8% dying, algorithms, more NeQFT, Vaintrob's interpretability agenda  
May: finals, reproductive frontiers conference, ILIAD retreat, Gleb in Cyprus, Palestine  
June: ears almost ruptured from 6 back-to-back layovers, surgery, formalization of Chomsky's syntax-semantics  
July: Softmax started, bad situation began unraveling, clarity  
August: Treehouse ended, Softmax ended, ODYSSEY & open problems, deep trauma   
September: started at Standard Intelligence     
October: Interact. the kindest thing someone's ever done for me. detangled & cut hair  
November: sunflower!   
December: NeurIPS, Post-AGI Workshop, (mostly) got out of a bad situation, happiness

<!-- When I was a kid, I loved reading. I lived in libraries and pestered my mother for book money. Sometimes she'd acquiesce and give me change; but the lack of local used bookstores in conjunction with the publishing economy meant that, in practice, I never had enough to buy any.  -->

<!-- *It was the best of times, it was the worst of times . . .*[^1]

[^1]: The summer before my third grade, Barnes & Noble had a $5/book deal on "classics." My mother knew a good deal when she saw one; I ended up with a complete collection of the works of Charles Dickens. I use this phrase fully knowing it's been beaten to death.  -->

2025 was odd. 

It was the best of times. I am happier today than I ever have been. I learned gorgeous and utilitarian concepts alike; I crossed the employability threshold and work with incredible comrades; I live in a home with some of my favorite people on the planet. I'll be 20 soon and the future is bright.

It was the worst of times. Mired in a haze of hopelessness and confusion. I spent months and months in pain and as an insomniac; I was cripplingly sick for half a year. For the first time, I have regrets. Proper ones, ones that I'll never forget as long as I live. 

It is good to have lived, maybe. I never want to let the preconditions for this year exist again. 

<h3>Ideas</h3>

Spent the first half of the year thinking about how to think about neural networks. Mean-field approaches to spin glasses, nonequilibrium QFT, KL bounds via stochastic coupling, depth-width tradeoffs, representational capacity (benchmarked by circuit complexity classes), singular learning theory, computational mechanics, variational reformulations of RL. Some of it was misguided, much was interesting. 

Vaintrob et. al. have been pursuing a QFT-inspired approach to interpretability. It's really cool, and I'm excited to (hopefully) see their empirical work come out this year. Dmitry's post on ["SLT as a thermodynamic theory of Bayesian learning, but not the thermodynamic theory of Bayesian learning"](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/M2bs6xCbmc79nwr8j/dmitry-vaintrob-s-shortform?commentId=A8Ziwhts35dgqbz52) is one of the most interesting I've read this year. 

Read Debreu on microeconomics. Yasheng Huang on Chinese capitalism. Ran a Land-focused reading group running through Bateson, Hegel, analytical Marxism, Kant, and Land himself. Finnegans Wake and EGA are both prime examples of [idiolects](https://www.yudhister.me/idiolects/). Yuxi Liu has a great blog. Read the formalization of Chomsky's syntax-semantics theory while recovering from surgery. Thought about chromosomal selection and inducing meiosis in oogonia at the Reproductive Frontiers conference. 

Summer rolled around, I was briefly back to 95% capacity, and I was contracting for ILIAD (the org) & planning to intern at Softmax. Making an open problems list for ODYSSEY (the conference) was enlightening. Curation is very, very difficult! Making sure that your theoretical brainchildren touch grass is almost as hard! 

Softmax forced me to properly learn to code. Programming is very different when done collaboratively in a shared codebase, doubly so when one's research code must be written quickly, efficiently, and in a manner interpretable to others. I'm glad I got to think about multi-agent RL and what makes good management good. 

My thoughts for the rest of the year were less legible. Tiling is an important problem. Formalizing it is hard. Acausal coalitional structure is confusing. Astronomical waste may or may not be an issue. Transpiling meta-ethical frameworks is hard. Biosingularitarian governance is hard. Is macrohistory determined by the nucleation stages of technological development or by deep convergent pressures leading to certain outcomes? How would we know?

At SI, we think about meta-learning and recurrence, among other things. Attempting to understand these deeply has been fruitful. A Berkeley professor ran a seminar on Adorno and poetry with a wonderful reading list. Semiotic physics is confusing, but Owain Evans has some good frames. Evolutionary optimization is surprisingly sample-efficient. Training deep neural networks is hard. Post-AGI futures are confusing and hard to think about, but Korinek has good frames. Weight-sparse models are deeply interesting. 

In 2026, I want to drastically shorten my map-territory feedback loops. Intellectually, my greatest flaw this year was not investing in it. Admittedly, I probably did not have the energy for it. Luckily, this year is shaping up to be different.  

<h3>Some Randomly Sampled Moments</h3>

[redacted]

<!-- - On my 19th birthday, we moved into Treehouse, but I couldn't board my flight from SoCal to SF because I didn't have a non-expired ID and kept failing background checks at TSA. I drove up Central Valley instead. My roommates were very kind to me and reserved the best room for me regardless. 
- I met a wise, kind, millenia-old vampire in Boston who remains perhaps the smartest person I've ever met. I will appreciate the conversation we had for a small eternity. 
- In February, I went on a long night walk with Aidan. I appreciate him for putting up with my phlegmatic coughing every five to ten steps, and also for taking my OOD experiences seriously.
- Watching Mickey 17 with Will was Great. 10/10 experience. 
- Visited CMU for Agent Foundations 2025. Stood on the Randy Pausch bridge, met Caspar again, Vanessa gave a talk that deconfused decision theory for me for about thirty minutes before I forgot core contextual pieces. 
- Long walk with the ex-MIRI agent foundations team in the Berkeley hills. Shouldn't have brought my backpack. 
- Listening to Zamenhof Counterpoint at SFCCO before heading to Pranav's birthday was pretty surreal. I'm glad there's some contemporary classical in the world that I absolutely adore. 
- Traveled to London for the ILIAD retreat. Learned a ridiculous amount. Proceeded to travel to Cyprus, then Israel, and take 6 back-to-back layovers returning to California, almost rupturing my eardrums. 
- Visited Gleb at NUP in Cyprus. Walked in on the ex-CEO of Yandex giving a talk on AI and mathematics. [Aphrodite's birthplace](https://yudhister.me/paphos). 
- While on a bus through the hasidic districts of Jerusalem, a reservist kept his assault rifle pointed at my chest the entire time with his hand on the trigger. Came close enough to get caught in my backpack's handle. 
- Went to Bethlehem, visited the church built on the land where Jesus is purported to have been born. Bought a bible. 
- Got my tonsils & adenoids removed & my septum straightened; was diagnosed with severe exercise-induced asthma. 
- Planned for interview. Had interview.

<h3> People </h3>

<!-- I want to thank those who I admire for living lives that I can now look up to. Abe Lincoln, Vannevar Bush, Feynman, Oppenheimer, Yuri Manin, Joyce, Paul Christiano, Thurston, Witten, . Many others I am missing.

I want to thank the inhabitants of Treehouse for agreeing to such a strange arrangement on such short notice, without knowing each other (or me) all that well, and for being, all things considered, quite reasonable housemates. 

I want to thank the current inhabitants of Sunflower for finally agreeing on a home.

I want to thank the colleagues I've been lucky to have this year at SI for being very reasonable and talented people. 

I want to thank Robert and Uli for providing me housing when I was cooked. 

Most importantly, I want to thank all my friends. I probably wouldn't be here without any of you.  -->

<!-- Aidan, Claire, Daniel, Devansh, Duncan, Ellen, Ethan, Galen, Gleb, Guillermo, Huxley, Janet, Jo, Kepha, Kushal, Lexi, Lev, Neel, Nils, Riya, Robert, Rowan, Savva, Sefika, Selena, Stag, Uli, Will, Yoyo. Obviously this is not exhaustive, but I am deeply grateful to know  -->
