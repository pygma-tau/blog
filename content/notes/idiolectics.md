I.

I speak. I often write to speak. Often I do not. “Often,” altered by analogy to “selden” from Middle English “ofte,” itself from Proto-Germanic *uftō*, itself an adverbialization of *ub*, under. 

My connectives here are strange. How can a word be “from” Middle English? “Of” is just an inclusion operation—admittedly with ludicrous levels of inherent dynamic typing—but “from” connotatively denotes “placehood.” Places exist in the world. Does Middle English exist as a place in the world? My comma in “*ub*, under” acts like a colon, itself a stand-in for “has property,” itself an overloaded term from the multiple conflicting definitions of “property.” I think “itself” is an implicit connective; you may not. I think I understand what “adverbialization” means, although I’ve never seen or heard it written or spoken. What is “Middle English” anyway?

Logicians distinguish languages from meta-languages. A proof is written in a meta-language as a step schema reducing one language statement to another. The steps themselves are sound within the language. Let’s say I want to write a proof in a given, formal metalanguage. I can! But somehow, if I want to explain it to you, we first return to the realm of “common parlance.” 

This parlance, the one you and I share, acts as its own meta-language. I suspect any parlance we find ourselves in is its own meta-language. Emergent idiolects wall off disciplines to outsiders, yet meaning-making continues between the disciplinarians. The Oxonian and Ghanaian cannot make common cause for lack of a shared tongue. 

II. 

Of course, this is *prima facie* absurd. The Ghanaian can learn English well enough; thousands of mathematics students decipher abstruse Bourbaki every year; an idiolect is not *isolate* in the sense that a species is *isolate*. 

- idiom : idiolect :: gene : species ?
- Conceptual closure as tied to the substructure
- Is Cartesian-ness doomed? 

idiolect ~ species
idiom ~ organism
token ~ gene
