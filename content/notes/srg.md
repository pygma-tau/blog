Hosting [a reading group Saturday mornings in SF](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19SAKceCAwatvJ2_CeDPQh1rPWF1otlfoTJTeKfXd7E0/edit?tab=t.0). Feel free to come!

The first 3 (maybe 4) weeks will be loosely structured around [LeCuit's Dynamics of information processing lecture](https://www.college-de-france.fr/en/agenda/lecture/what-is-biological-information-continued/dynamics-of-information-processing) at the Collège de France. We'll be following Alon's Introduction to Systems Biology and be inspired by Thom's Structrual Stability and Morphogenesis.

After that I want to talk about post-AGI futures! And LLM macro-properties, and some other things. Should be fun! 

The only etiquette I ask is that you only come if you do the minimum viable reading.
