alternative titles: "variations on Metastability", 

characterization: not stable, not hierarchical. in-between. convex or sharp basin. 

I.

Intrinsically disordered proteins. Specific example of function mediation. 

(mesoscopic phenomena? what is a good example of mesoscopy in thermodynamics? conservation laws?)

II. 

metastable degeneration in attention mechanism. LLMs have more crystallized than fluid intelligence. does it matter that features are linearly represented? do you need algebraic richness to be a stable meta-learner?

III. 

note on humans? autism as a dimensionality curse (cf. Michael Edward Johnson). humans in groups seem to perform better than humans alone. does this imply that organizations / multicellular organisms are more robust / can more easily exist in meta-stable states? is this because of internal bottlenecks (cf. Conway's law?)

IV.

narrativistic meta-stability. the death of rigor. limits to legibility. delusion. Joyce & DFW. annealing. 

(need characters / plotlines from Joyce)

V. 

local adaptivity vs. global adaptivity. selection pressures on good local heuristics vs. global ones. what does the cultural singularity look like?what sorts of ethical systems persist? singleton agent modularity + application allows for engaging with stable or metastable interfaces at each level. psychology is meta-stable, cells are crystallized, etc. 

phase transitions? hierarchical complexity? music? what does this imply about the existence of general meta-learners? 

current regimes (and any human generated regimes) cannot really leverage the true complexity of the world, because we are applying optimization pressure. optimization pressure is a fundamentally local phenomenon. 

non-hierarchical, non-modular systems? how to make? induction vs. deduction as primitive? 

something about mode-connectivity of loss-landscapes
