In 2017, the Solvay conference on physics was hosted on "The Physics of Living Matter: Space, Time, and Information in Biology." [A link to the proceedings.](https://solvayinstitutes.be/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Proceedings-Physics-2017.pdf) They are wonderful. 

The first tidbit that caught my eye was from Dr. Brangwyne on the "Self-Assembly of Intracellular Matter:"

> *One question that one can start to ask here is what sorts of theoretical
approaches should we be taking to try and understand phase separation within
the context of a living cell? Perhaps the simplest thing one can write down is a
version of the Flory–Huggins/Regular Solution free energy:*
> $$\frac{F}{k_BT} = \phi \ln \phi + (1-\phi) \ln (1-\phi) + \chi\phi(1-\phi)$$
> *This is the free energy as a function of concentration or mole fraction ($\phi$) in a
binary system. The first two terms represent the entropic contributions, which
want the system to be well-mixed. But the third term is the contribution that
arises from protein-protein interaction, which are encoded in this Flory $\chi$ parameter,
which reflects the relative heterotypic versus the average homotypic interaction
energy. If $\chi$ is large enough, i.e. if heterotypic interactions are energetically costly
compared to homotypic interactions, then the system will want to phase separate
into a two-phase equilibrium state. The dynamics of the phase-separation process
are often described by the Cahn–Hilliard equation, which one can view as a kind of
diffusion equation which takes into account not only the entropy (as in usual Fickian
diffusion) but also the molecular interactions.*
