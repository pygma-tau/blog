**1.2.2:** A natural guess is that $Z_N = 1 + \prod\_{i=1}^N e^{X_i}$ for some suitable family of distributions $\\{X_i\\}$ such that $\mathbb{E} \log Z_N \sim N$ while $\log \mathbb{E} Z_N$ grows sublinearly (we add $1$ to meet the $Z_N \geq 1$ condition). In particular, one can choose i.i.d. $X_i = \mathcal{N}(0,2).$ Then, $\mathbb{E}[e^{X_i}] = $
