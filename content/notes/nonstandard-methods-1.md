When I was younger, combinatorics displeased me. Why should Nature have the right to hide Truth behind opaque symbol-pushing proofs with no apparent rhyme or reason? As I've aged I've warmed to the subject—there's something beautiful about the power of raw argument when applied to simple domains—and Ramsey theory in particular is gorgeous. But a class of approaches that I'm quite partial to manages to use a grand infinitary condition (namely, Łoś' Theorem) to prove often finitary results in the realm of combinatorics. We call these "nonstandard methods" (inspired from "nonstandard analysis"). Here are a few proofs. 

(I claim no originality in this exposition: most can be found in Di Nasso et. al.'s *Nonstandard Methods in Ramsey Theory and Combinatorial Number Theory*.)

The central claim we will be referring to repeatedly throughout this blogpost is the *transfer principle*: that there exists a model of the structure at hand infinitely larger than it yet which preserves its first-order properties. These models can sometimes be specified, but often their existence is simply taken for granted (the hyperreals are a peculiar case in which a construction is well-known). Specifically, we claim that for
