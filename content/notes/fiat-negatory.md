We'd like to understand a mind's effects on the world. To do this, we'd like to understand the structures / elements which determine / designate mind trajectories (preferably over long horizons).

Descriptively, minds can often be said to have goals. The minds we currently observe most often have goals, and goal-oriented frames provide short, accurate compressions of mind outputs. 

How does a mind come to have a goal? All observed minds, artificial or otherwise, do not exist absent amental structure. They are grown through a deterministic (enough) process, on silicon or biological substrate, such that all goal-drivers have a "physical" representation in the corresponding mind-artifact. "Physical" explanations for goal development include:

- tracing the development of circuits in a neural network over the course of training;
- endocrinal perspectives on the upregulation / downregulation of various hormones leading to increased sex drive / etc.;
- neuroscientific perspectives on "the steering system" and reward functions lying therein;
- evolutionary perspectives on "why we seek out sweet food" and, perhaps contentiously, on social behaviors and psychology writ large. 

Each is a valid explanation in context. Yet I'd argue none properly engage with "mentalistic" aspects of mind: the structures / elements of mind-systems unified by their predominance in minds and lack elsewhere. Insofar as we expect goals to be common properties of minds, we'd expect the structures / elements of minds to contribute to their development. 

Tsvi [hypothesizes](https://tsvibt.blogspot.com/2022/11/do-humans-derive-values-from-fictitious.html) that a dominant driver of human behavior is a reflective process in which a human mind finds itself ascribing goals in accordance with what goals it would make sense for the human mind to have *conditioning on the past history of its actions.*[^1] He calls this "the Fictitious Imputed Adopted Telos hypothesis." FIAT provides plausible, "mentalistic" explanations for goal development, in that a mind's drive for coherence (a mentalistic property) lets it amplify more "hard-coded" drives into goals that are more general than the initial activation state of the drive, by generalizing from commonalities between past experience. 

signs in goal-development are qualitiatively different. attractive dynamics to points in WM are convergent and ~overdetermined, repulsive dynamics from points in WM are quite underconstrained. FIAT dynamics are quite mentalistic. what happens if we adapt them to negatory goals? e.g. you can imagine "update away" is an atomic motion comparable to "update towards". 

consider Bateson's schismogenesis: aspects of mind-structure engaging w/negatory goal development in ways that are pathological. negatory goal development in minds is probably overwhelmingly pathological? argument against FIAT implementing negatory goal development is that Bateson's schismogenesis is likely, overwhelmingly not mechanistically accurate (given genetic propensity to schizophrenia)

braitenberg feedback loops here?



[^1]: I note that he operates within the frame of "deriving values" rather than "determining goals." I don't do this because I think grounding the analysis in goals is sounder (the observational evidence for "goals" being "real" is much stronger, given that "values" are fundamentally properties internal to minds and are typically either argued for with either coherence-like structural arguments or with relatively weak "interpretability"-shaped probes, either in the neuroscience literature or the more modern interpretability field)
