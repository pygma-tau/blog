**I.**

a blade of grass hides  
minuscule migratory men  
Lilliputian fiends  

**II.**

mighty merry rascals  
fickle, high off foglefreude  
die English skippers  

**III.**

I once beheld Seneca's estate,  
Credulously inspecting his wicker tomb—  
Yet Margate Mennons and liced defendants  
Both swore by its awkward loom.  

My heart gasped and lips shuddered  
When, to my utmost surprise  
The elderly Roman statesman lay  
As mummified nitride.  

Tick-tock, goes the clock  
Garrulous gyrations too  
Gizzardly Gentry, nice surprise  
Confiding in a martyr's womb.  

Foiled! the cuckoo's dead—  
Not I, not I, not I!  
Lambastation! Aberration!  
To defy Nero's evil eye.  

**IV.** 

weed stands stout   
thistles, burr  
gadolinum kraut  
hummus and herb  

olden spires bristle, copper-waxed  
kelpish tides awash blades of glass  
Betty stout, orange'd brass  
vermillion mounts, dugong grass

betwixed, witched, yonder   
your shivers roll down my spine    
I gave you a bouquet of thorned tulips  
at sunrise, on Cocoa Beach

the rocket's red glare, the bombs  
bursting over a lackadaiscal mare  
I wish Martians dreamt of the stars  
alas
