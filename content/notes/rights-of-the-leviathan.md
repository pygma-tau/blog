[[see Leviathan XVII](https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/3207/pg3207-images.html)]

[1]. Revolution is illegitimate. Sovereign power is derived from the one-time consent of the governed. Not only is it illegitimate to attempt a contractual renegotiation, it is unjust; doubly so if done in the name of God. 

[2]. Sovereigns do not contract with the People. Such a construction is structurally incoherent. Thus sovereign authority cannot be forefeited, and regardless the state maintains a monopoly on violence. 

[3]. Protest is illegitimate. 

[4]. A subject cannot justly critique a sovereign's actions, as partaking in the Covenant consequently places the responsibility for the sovereign's actions on the subject. 

[5]. Sovereigns are unpunishable. 

[6]. Matters of peace and defence are solely the purview of the sovereign, domestic or otherwise. Education of the populace likewise. 

[7]. Law-making is the sole purview of the sovereign, with the aim of ensuring the consituency acts peaceably and justly. 

[8]. The power to judge "controversy", be it legal or factual, belongs to the sovereign.

[9]. The sovereign has the sole authority to make war and peace. 

[10]. The sovereign has the sole authority to staff an executive. 

[11]. The sovereign may reward or punish his subjects as he sees fit. 

[12]. The sovereign maintains a monopoly on status signifiers and honors conferred on subjects.
