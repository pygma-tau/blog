**(Lee 1.7)** Let $N,S$ be the north and south poles of $\mathbb{S}^n$ embedded with unit radius in $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$. Below we discuss various properties of the stereographic projection $\sigma: \mathbb{S}^n \setminus \\{N\\} \to \mathbb{R}^n,$ where 
$$
\sigma(x^1, \ldots, x^{n+1}) = \frac{(x^1, \ldots, x^{n})}{1-x^{n+1}}.
$$

(a) We show $\sigma(x)$ projects onto the equatorial plane through the line connecting $x$ and $N$. Let $l(t) = (1-t)N + tx$ parametrize the line through point $x = (x^1, \ldots, x^{n+1})$ on $\mathbb{S}^n$ and the north pole. Via a component-wise analysis, one checks that $l(t)$ intersects the equatorial plane when $1-t + tx^{n+1}=0,$ implying $t = \frac{1}{1-x^{n+1}}.$ Call this $t'.$ Then $l(t') = \sigma(x),$ completing the proof. [not sure if this is correct]

**Problem.** Prove that the antipodal map $\alpha: \mathbb{S}^n \to \mathbb{S}^n$ given by $\alpha(x) = -x$ is smooth.
