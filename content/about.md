I study comparative literature at Berkeley. I am currently interested in homotopy theory, optimal transport, and QFTâ€”but I am easily distracted!

Not too long ago, I thought about agents at [MATS](https://matsprogram.org) and the [Center on Long-Term Risk](https://longtermrisk.org), briefly built audio models at [Standard Intelligence](https://si.inc), and helped run [ASPR](https://aspr.camp) (a Taiwanese rationality camp). I am an [Atlas Fellow](https://atlasfellowship.org), [Rise Fellow](https://www.risefortheworld.org/), and an [Emergent Ventures](https://www.mercatus.org/emergent-ventures) winner.

Check out some of my friends!
