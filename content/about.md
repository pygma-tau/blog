Presently: 
- pretraining computer action models at [Standard Intelligence](https://si.inc/);
- thinking about agent foundations with [ILIAD](https://www.iliad.ac/). 

Previously:
- multi-agent RL at [Softmax](https://softmax.com/);
- open-source game theory with [Caspar Oesterheld](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/coesterh/) at [MATS](https://matsprogram.org);
- applied philosophy with [Abram Demski](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=tsrblo8AAAAJ&hl=en) at the [Center on Long-Term Risk](https://longtermrisk.org). 

I live in San Francisco.

When I was 16, I dropped out of high school and spent a year and a half with no permanent address. This had predictable and unpredictable consequences.

<!-- Side quests:
- In the first semester of our freshman year, a friend and I decided to start a formal verification startup. We spent two weeks making a flotsam Ada-to-Rust transpiler and YC rejected us at interview for being too early. 
- Quite a while ago, I used to be a classical pianist and help run A/V for my high school -->
