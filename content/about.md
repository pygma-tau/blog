I train models at Standard Intelligence and study mathematics at Berkeley. Previously, I worked on multi-agent RL at Softmax, modeling decision theories at MATS, and probabilistic logics at the Center on Long-Term Risk. 

Some communities dear to my heart: FABRIC, Atlas, Rise, Emergent Ventures, Interact.
