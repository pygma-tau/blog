Presently: 
- pretraining computer action models at [Standard Intelligence](https://si.inc/);
- thinking about agent foundations with [ILIAD](https://www.iliad.ac/). 

Previously:
- multi-agent RL at [Softmax](https://softmax.com/);
- open-source game theory at [MATS 5.0](https://matsprogram.org);
- applied philosophy at the [Center on Long-Term Risk](https://longtermrisk.org). 

I live in San Francisco.

I am an [Atlas Fellow](https://www.atlasfellowship.org/), [Rise Fellow](https://www.risefortheworld.org/winners/yudhister-joel-kumar), and an [Emergent Ventures winner](https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2022/12/emergent-ventures-23rd-cohort.html). 

I moonlight as a Berkeley student, where I am a [Regents & Chancellor's Scholar](https://financialaid.berkeley.edu/types-of-aid-at-berkeley/scholarships/regents-and-chancellors-scholarship/). 

When I was 16, I dropped out of high school and spent a year and a half with no permanent address. This had predictable and unpredictable consequences.

I love my friends. You should check them out!

<!-- Side quests:
- In the first semester of our freshman year, a friend and I decided to start a formal verification startup. We spent two weeks making a flotsam Ada-to-Rust transpiler and YC rejected us at interview for being too early. 
- Quite a while ago, I used to be a classical pianist and help run A/V for my high school -->
