I study at Berkeley. This summer I'm working at [Softmax](https://softmax.com), and previously I've been at [MATS](https://matsprogram.org) and the [Center on Long-Term Risk](https://longtermrisk.org).

Often I find myself becoming a simulacrum of what I wanted to be. I'm not sure what this means, but I'd like to figure it out.
