<summary>C. West Churchman, <i>The Systems Approach</i></summary>

A core question this book studies is what it means to be a "management scientist": is it possible to study the management of a system without being an active party in it? Could you plan a system effectively even when considering yourself a part of it? Churchman doesn't quite provide a definitive answer to the question, but is certainly sympathetic to the affirmative.

Perhaps there are four archetypes of Systems Approach users:

> The debaters are these: 
> 
> (1) The advocates of efficiency; they claim that the best approach to a system is to identify the trouble spots, and especially the places where there is waste, e.g., unnecessarily high costs, and then proceed to remove the inefficiency.
> 
> (2) The advocates of the use of science in approaching a system; they claim that there is an objective way to look at a system and to build a "model" of the system that describes how it works. The science that is used is sometimes mathematics, sometimes economics, sometimes "behavioral" (e.g., psychology and sociology).
> 
> (3) The advocates of the use of human feelings, ie., the humanists; they claim that systems are people, and the fundamental approach to systems consists of first looking at the human values: freedom, dignity, privacy. Above all, they say, the systems approach should avoid imposing plans, i.e., intervention of any kind.
> 
> (4) The anti-planners, who believe that any attempt to lay out specific and "rational" plans is either foolish or dangerous or downright evil. The correct "approach" to systems is to live in them, to react in terms of one's experience, and not to try to change them by means of some grandiose scheme or mathematical model. There are all kinds of anti-planners, but the most numerous are those who believe that experience and cleverness are the hallmarks of good management.*

The author is clearly a Scientist, and believes in the potential of the scientific approach in both domains easily amenable to decomposition and quantitative modeling and those not.

The Scientist believes that efficiency-maximizers are old-fashioned and too simplistic. Obviously one must consider efficiency in the context of the broader system! Efficiency for efficiency's sake could have adverse second-order consequences!

The Scientist has some difficulty engaging with what some might call the "human perspective", and especially when dealing with value conflicts regarding the design of certain institutions. Operationalizing human values often takes the form of poorly lumping them in as economic considerations, or perhaps applying methods from behavioral science (haha.). As always, the Scientist's approach's effectiveness is directly downstream of the underlying ability of the system to be modeled, and we have not yet figured out how to nicely decompose sociological problems into an n-part moving system with edge relationships between the nodes.

Anti-planners aren't even trying.

> With this in mind, we can outline five basic considerations that the scientist believes must be kept in mind when thinking about the meaning of a system:
> 
> 1. the total system objectives and, more specifically, the performance measures of the whole system;
> 2. the system's environment: the fixed constraints;
> 3. the resources of the system;
> 4. the components of the system, their activities, goals and measures of performance;
> 5. the management of the system.

Various dated case studies litter the rest of the book. One historical note is that "systems thinking" was developed in the military and especially in the aerospace industry: after World War Two, corporations looked at the effectiveness of e.g. fighter jet development and wanted some of it for themselves.

Two takeaways I found interesting were an inerrant focus on simplicity in modeling and a kind of self-referentiality paradox:

> These considerations bring us to the last aspect of the system, its management. The management of a system has to deal with the generation of the plans for the system, i.e., consideration of all of the things we have discussed, the overall goals, the environment, the utilization of resources, and the components. The management sets the component goals, allocates the resources, and controls the system performance. This description of management, however, creates something of a paradox for the management scientist. After all, it is he who has been scheming and plotting with his models and analyses to determine the goals, environment, resources, and components. Is he, therefore, the manager; does he intend to "take over" with his computer army?
> 
> The truth of the matter is that he doesn't want to. He is not a man of action, but a man of ideas. A man of action takes risks, and if he fails, not only does he get fired but his organization may be ruined; the man of action is willing to risk fortunes besides his own. The management scientist is typically a single risk-taker: if he fails, he doesn't have to bear the responsibility of the whole organization's failure.
> 
> Hence, we've found one chink in the scientist's armor: he doesn't really understand how he himself is a component of the system he observes. He likes to think that he can stand apart, like the elephant observer, and merely recommend, but not act. How naive this must appear to the politician is hard to say, but certainly the politician's appreciation of the situation is the more sophisticated one. "Mere" recommendation is a fantasy; in the management scientist's own terminology, it is doubtful whether the study of a system is a separable mission.

<summary>Yasheng Huang, <i>Capitalism with Chinese Characteristics: Entrepreneurship and the State</i></summary>

Notable:  
- TVEs (township and village enterprises), while often nominally state-owned, were *de facto* private enterprises, and as such outcompeted SOEs (state-owned enterprises). Rural TVEs were often non-agricultural, typically in the industries of commerce and manufacturing, and survived in large part because of policies allowing for the resurgence of RCCs (rural credit cooperatives) as private lending institutions.  
  - In 1985, RCCs accounted for 76.8 percent of all agricultural loans and 47.8 percent of all loans extended to TVEs. Post Tiananmen Square, RCCs were restricted to solely providing credit for agricultural purposes, curtailing entrepreneurship for the manifest reason that *most entrepreneurs started their business to get out of agriculture.
  - TVEs (in English) refer to *xiangzhen qiye* (rural and township enterprise) rather than *xiangcun qiye* (township and village enterprise). TVEs refer to the entire *xiangzhen qiye* phenomenon, which includes collective TVEs and straightforward rural private enterprises, while *xiangcun qiye* just refers to collective TVEs.
- Wenzhou Province served as a pioneer and bellwether for the reformist orientation to the "private sector" broadly, and specifically with regards to informal finance. In Guizhou Province (the poorest), fully 68.9% of households had taken informal credit, and 81% of private credit loans were used for production.
- Unlike other East Asian economies, the Chinese investment to GDP ratio *increased* as Chinese GDP increased, such that investment accounted for fully 50% of Chinese GDP in 2005. It can be argued that such obscene investment levels serve as a *substitute* for entrepreneurship, and would have been unnecessary only if China continued its pseudo-liberal policies of the 1980s.  
  - In fact, such large investments in infrastructure came at the cost of investment in rural education and public health, directly leading to increased illiteracy rates and a marked decrease in improving infant mortality rates. Additionally, productivity growth stagnated.
- Considering Shanghai an innovation hub is misleading. Zhejiang and Guangdong surpassed Shanghai in patent grants in the early 1990s, from 0.3x in the mid 1980s, due to their more entrepreneur-favoring policies. (This is especially striking when you note that Shanghai had between 3-6x more research scientists and R&D spending).
- Urban entrepreneurs in Yunnan and Shanghai earned similar amounts, when the GDP per capita in Yunnan is one tenth that of Shanghai.
- Personal income per capita and GDP per capita were negatively correlated in Shanghai in the 1990s.
- India creates (where the present tense refers to ~2008) more value per laborer than China and is better at retaining wealth.

Summary of main points given by author:

> - Explicitly private entrepreneurship in the non-farm sectors developed vigorously and rapidly in rural China during the 1980s.
> - Financial reforms, again in the rural areas, were substantial in the 1980s, and the Chinese banking system channeled a surprisingly high level of credits to the private sector in the 1980s.
> - Conventional property rights security was — and still is — problematic, but the security of the proprietor — the person holding the property — increased substantially at the very onset of the economic reforms. The Chinese policy makers in the early 1980s strongly, directly, and self-consciously projected policy credibility and predictability.
> - The political system, although absent of the normal institutional constraints associated with good governance, became directionally liberal early during the reform era.

On reforms:
> - The Chinese definition of TVEs refers to their locations of establishments and registration (i.e., businesses located in the rural areas), not their ownership; Western researchers, on the other hand, have come to understand TVEs in terms of their ownership status.
> - The cognitive gap is huge: As early as 1985, of the 12 million businesses classified as TVEs, 10 million were completely and manifestly private. Almost every single net entrant in the TVE sector between the mid- 1980s and the mid-1990s was a private TVE; thus both the static and dynamic TVE phenomena were substantially private.
> - Private TVEs were most vibrant in the poorest and the most agricultural provinces of China (and this feature of private TVEs also explains the understatement of their size in the conventional reporting as well as the connections between rural private entrepreneurship and poverty alleviation).
> - There are reports of privatization of collective TVEs in the early 1980s and large-scale privatizations in the poor provinces.
> - Rural financial reforms — credit provisions to the private sector and allowing a degree of private entry into financial services — in the 1980s were endorsed by the governor of the central bank and the presidents of the major commercial banks.
> - Chinese reforms were heavily experimental in nature rather than relying on a blueprint approach, but the outcome of the experimentation was private ownership and financial liberalization.
> - By the measure of private-sector fixed-asset investments, the most liberal policy epoch, by far, was in the 1980s; in the 1990s, the policy was reversed, and many of the productive rural financial experiments were discontinued.
> - Rural administrative management was substantially centralized in the 1990s.
> - Credit constraints on rural entrepreneurship, including private TVEs, rose substantially in the 1990s.
> - Growth of rural household income in the 1990s was less than half of its growth in the 1980s, and the declining growth in the rural business income was especially pronounced.
> - The size of government — measured in terms of headcounts of officials and the value of fixed assets it controls — expanded enormously in the 1990s.
> - The directionally liberal political reforms of the 1980s were discontinued and reversed.

On Shanghai:
> - Although they are located in the richest market in China, indigenous private-sector businesses in Shanghai are among the smallest in the country, and self-employment business income per capita is about the same in Shanghai as it is in provinces such as Yunnan, where GDP per capita is about 10 to 15 percent of that in Shanghai. (As an illustration of how unusual the above pattern is, imagine finding that self-employment business income per capita in the United States was about the same as that in Turkey.)
> - The political, regulatory, and financial restrictions on indigenous private entrepreneurship in Shanghai were extreme, as evidenced by the fact that the fixed asset investments by the indigenous private-sector firms peaked in 1985.
> - The share of labor income — inclusive of proprietor income — to GDP is very low in Shanghai.
> - Shanghai's GDP increased massively relative to the national mean, but the household income level relative to the national mean experienced almost no growth.
> - Although wage income is high in Shanghai, asset income is among the lowest in the country.
> - Since 2000, the poorest segment of Shanghai's population has lost income absolutely during a period of double-digit economic growth. Although aspiring to be a high-tech hub of China, the number of annual patent grants in Shanghai decreased substantially relative to that in the more entrepreneurial provinces, such as Zhejiang and Guangdong, in the 1990s.
> - Shanghai was also corrupt.

On consequences:
> - Although GDP growth was rapid during both the 1980s and 1990s, household income growth was much faster in the 1980s.
> - The share of labor income to GDP was rising in the 1980s but declining in the 1990s.
> - Several studies on total factor productivity (TFP) converged on the finding that TFP growth since the late 1990s has either slowed down from the earlier period or has completely collapsed.
> - The majority of the much-touted poverty reduction occurred during the short 8 years of the entrepreneurial era (1980-1988) rather than during the long 13 years of the state-led era (1989-2002).
> - Income disparities worsened substantially in the 1990s, while they initially improved in the 1980s.
> - Governance problems, such as land grabs and corruption, intensified greatly in the 1990s.
> - The heavy taxation on the rural areas led to the withdrawal and rising costs of basic government services.
> - Between 2000 and 2005 the number of illiterate Chinese adults increased by 30 million, reversing decades of trend developments; this development has garnered almost no attention in the West.
> - The way the Chinese measure adult illiteracy implies that all of this increase was a product of the rural basic education in the 1990s, and this adverse development coincided closely in timing with the intensification of urban bias in the policy model.

misc:
- urbanization -> centralization of power? Jane Jacobs might have something to say here?
- much FDI just allowed for capital to be more efficiently used in China by routing through Hong Kong. See Lenovo
- Stiglitz's perspective on TVEs was just plain wrong?
