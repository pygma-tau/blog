I used to read widely. Never the same book twice. Over time I became intensely dissatisfied with my understanding of the world. I spoke of topics while my words rung shallow, I was right without ever quite knowing why. Writing, speaking, *thinking* felt empty. It was not that I had never understood, nor that I could not with some effort. The understanding was just never all mine. 

Now I only read the books below, and in some sense [treat them as a set of prompts for data generation](https://x.com/karpathy/status/1969699013671678382). As AI advances, I suspect the value of shallow understanding will crater while the value of deep understanding will rise, so in another sense these represent the intellectual bets I want to make over the next decade. Consider choosing your bets as well.
