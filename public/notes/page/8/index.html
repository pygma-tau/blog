                            <p>Possibly the most comprehensive extant anthology of rituals, especially Anglo-Saxon rituals. It opens with some historical notes, a discussion on the germane characteristics of magic, and applications / motivations of common ritualistic ingredients.</p>
<p>Storms notes that it is incoherent to consider magic as descending from animism, just as it is incoherent to consider religion as descending from animism. Given that magical practices were considered to have effects independent of the effects wrought on the world by spirits or phantoms, the two traditions obviously coexisted rather than being dependent on each other. Additionally:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Another argument against animism as the explanation of all magic is that the spirits themselves are subject to the power of magic, which would be hard to account for if they were the originators of that power. . . . A form of magic that is spread all over the world is that in which a man is killed by means of an effigy. . . . There is nothing animistic in this form of magic and it is based on the principle that like influences like, and that a thing that has once had contact with another thing remains irrevocably connected with it. Its effect is probably due to suggestion and autosuggestion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What is magic?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In defining magic we have to bear in mind the practical side of magic, that is, the way in which it operates, and the theoretical side, that is, the notions, conceptions and beliefs that are the basis and origin of magical practices. We define magic as the art of employing a personal power that operates in such a way as cannot be perceived by physical sense and that is carred into effect by means of a traditional ritual.</p>
<p>The underlying idea of magic is that of power, force, or strength. Primitive man does not distinguish between ordinary, normal, natural power and extraordinary, abnormal, supernatural or preternatural, magical, spiritual, or even divine power. As Graebener says: "The Australian aborigines do not regard the natural as supernatural, but the supernatural as natural." A medicine man has not two functions but one function; he does not apply two methods but one method. Curing a patient by magic or by natural means is one and the same thing in the mind of a witch-doctor; he cures a sick man ans there is the end of it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It follows, then, that there was no inherent difference between the rules by which normal procedures or magical procedures were meant to work. In fact, Storms claims that originally "all magical practices were simple and straightforward", and that their opacity was added later purely to enhance mystery amongst onlookers.</p>
<p>Anglo-Saxon magic primarily draws upon Christian and pagan influence (Icelandic, Germanic, Celtic, classical). Woden is one of the only gods frequently mentioned by name in suriving rituals, and distinguishing e.g. Germanic from classical influence is infintely harder than distinguishing Christian and pagan.</p>
<p>Rules for rituals would encompass an entire volume in and of themselves, but it is notable that the more pungent the ingredient the stronger its perceived effect was. From this, you get goat dung as a wound salve.</p>
<p>The earliest instance of an individual using a word with the function of "magic" to describe certain practices was Herodotus describing a class of Persian astronomer-priests. When you consider magic as primarily the domain of primitive peoples, it makes sense that from a civilized perspective one would want to reify it (and subsequently kill it in the process). So, the best way to study rituals is to treat them as a practice rather than the outcome of some established metaphysics.</p>
<p>His primary sources are the Leechbook and the Lacnunga.</p>

                            <h2><a href="https://yudhister.me/lenin-imperialism/">Review | Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism</a></h2>
                            <time datetime="2024-10-23">October 23, 2024</time>
                        </header>
                        <div class="post-content">
                            <p>Concepts featured: natural tendency towards monopolization, power-law distribution of production, virtues of vertical integration, value accretion to speculators, capital oligpolies, capital export.</p>
<p>The basic argument:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Imperialism emerged as the development and direct continuation of the fundamental characteristics of capitalism in general. But capitalism only became capitalist imperialism at a definite and very high stage of its development, when certain of its fundamental characteristics began to change into their opposites, when the features of the epoch of transition from capitalism to a higher social and economic system had taken shape and revealed themselves in all spheres. <strong>Economically, the main thing in this process is the displacement of capitalist free competition by capitalist monopoly.</strong> Free competition is the basic feature of capitalism, and of commodity production generally; monopoly is the exact opposite of free competition, but we have seen the latter being transformed into monopoly before our eyes, creating large-scale industry and forcing out small industry, replacing large-scale by still larger-scale industry, and carrying concentration of production and capital to the point where out of it has grown and is growing monopoly: cartels, syndicates and trusts, and merging with them, the capital of a dozen or so banks, which manipulate thousands of millions. At the same time the monopolies, which have grown out of free competition, do not eliminate the latter, but exist above it and alongside it, and thereby give rise to a number of very acute, intense antagonisms, frictions and conflicts. Monopoly is the transition from capitalism to a higher system.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lenin is surprisingly perceptive. Or, perhaps, his ideology tended to notice inconvenient truths about the "market" economies of the Gilded Age (most of which are downstream of markets having power-law distributions in outcomes) such as the centralization of not just raw material production, but commodity production and capital itself.</p>
<p>Repeatedly, I have seen the biggest flaw of pre-WW2 Marxist analysis to be its inability to predict or even notice the effects of technological innovation on the common man.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It goes without saying that if capitalism could develop agriculture, which today is everywhere lagging terribly behind industry, if it could raise the living standards of the masses, who in spite of the amazing technical progress are everywhere still half-starved and poverty-stricken, there could be no question of a surplus of capital. This “argument” is very often advanced by the petty-bourgeois critics of capitalism. But if capitalism did these things it would not be capitalism; for both uneven development and a semi-starvation level of existence of the masses are fundamental and inevitable conditions and constitute premises of this mode of production. <em>As long as capitalism remains what it is, surplus capital will be utilised not for the purpose of raising the standard of living of the masses in a given country, for this would mean a decline in profits for the capitalists, but for the purpose of increasing profits by exporting capital abroad to the backward countries.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sure, the Haber process was incubated and developed on the government's dime. But BASF then matured and implemented it, massively multiplying crop yields <em>because there was money in it</em>. Only capital-rich organizations can afford to invest in 0-1 jumps, and nations happen to be capital-rich organizations which work for the public benefit. Yet the exact ills of monopolies are also boons: vertical integration and large scale production allows the 1-many innovations to be implemented.</p>
<p>Regardless, companies will take the low-hanging fruit, and the low-hanging fruit in the early 20th century was investing in colonies. Railways, oil, coal, metals, cash crops, etc.. Marx and Engels claim that this results in the "bourgeoisification" of the British working class, as the profits from such foreign investment accrue in Britain rather than South Africa, and that British labor unions were pro-imperialist. This seems to be broadly correct.</p>
<p>Capital as export is a powerful force:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In 1904, Great Britain had 50 colonial banks with 2,279 branches (in 1910 there were 72 banks with 5,449 branches), France had 20 with 136 branches; Holland, 16 with 68 branches; and Germany had “only” 13 with 70 branches.68 The American capitalists, in their turn, are jealous of the English and German: “In South America,” they complained in 1915, “five German banks have forty branches and five British banks have seventy branches.... Britain and Germany have invested in Argentina, Brazil, and Uruguay in the last twenty-five years approximately four thousand million dollars, and as a result together enjoy <em>46 per cent of the total trade of these three countries.</em>”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He also makes the argument that the cause of net immigration to the colonial powers rather than net emigration from them is that such profit accruement decreases the incentives to leave:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One of the special features of imperialism connected with the facts I am describing, is the decline in emigration from imperialist countries and the increase in immigration into these countries from the more backward countries where lower wages are paid. As Hobson observes, emigration from Great Britain has been declining since 1884. In that year the number of emigrants was 242,000, while in 1900, the number was 169,000. Emigration from Germany reached the highest point between 1881 and 1890, with a total of 1,453,000 emigrants. In the course of the following two decades, it fell to 544,000 and to 341,000. On the other hand, there was an increase in the number of workers entering Germany from Austria, Italy, Russia and other countries. According to the 1907 census, there were 1,342,294 foreigners in Germany, of whom 440,800 were industrial workers and 257,329 agricultural workers. In France, the workers employed in the mining industry are, “in great part”, foreigners: Poles, Italians and Spaniards. In the United States, immigrants from Eastern and Southern Europe are engaged in the most poorly paid jobs, while American workers provide the highest percentage of overseers or of the better-paid workers. Imperialism has the tendency to create privileged sections also among the workers, and to detach them from the broad masses of the proletariat.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Centering the <em>monopoly</em> as simultaneously alien to the free market and yet the inevitable result of a free market is particularly poignant, I feel. His other analyses are interesting from a historical perspective, but without intimate knowledge of the context they should not be wholly trusted.My translation was particularly good. Quite happy with it.</p>

                            <p>Finite state automata (FSA) can be modeled with reactions of the form $A + B \to C + D.$ FSAs operate over regular languages, so our job is to find some reaction which corresponds to determining whether or not a given "word" (sequence of inputs to the reaction) is a member of the language.</p>
<p>Generally, we will be associating languages of various grammars in the Chomsky hierarchy to certain combinations of "aliquots" added to a one-pot reaction, and in this case we want our aliquots to be potassium iodide and silver nitride. Take the language over the alphabet ${a,b}$ consisting of all words with at least one $a$ and one $b.$ Now associate $a$ with some part of $\text{KIO}_3$ and $b$ with some part of $\text{AgNO}_3.$ Then, the reaction
$$
\text{KIO}_3 + \text{AgNO}_3 \to \text{AgIO}_3 (\text{s}) + \text{KNO}_3
$$
only occurs when both of the reactants are present in solution, so the word is in the language <em>if and only if silver iodide is present.</em> (Or, equivalently, heat is released).</p>
<p>Type-2 grammars consist of languages that can be modeled with pushdown automatas, which differ from FSAs in that they have a stack that can store strings of arbitrary sizes. We call these languages "context-free languages", and the reactions which we associate to context-free languages are those with intermediaries. Again, because of automata equivalence, we can consider the simple case of the Dyck language: the collection of parentheses-strings that never contain more closed parentheses than open parentheses at any $i$ and contain exactly equal amounts of closed and open parentheses at $i=n.$</p>
<p>We associate this with the $pH$ reaction of sodium hydroxide and acetic acid (vinegar), with the amounts of each aliquot normalized to create identical disturbances in the $pH$ of the solution. Note that as $pH$ indicator aliquot is present at the beginning and end of the reaction (we associate it with the start-and-end token), the aliquot serves as the intermediary (the "stack", if you will). So, if $pH \geq \text{midpoint } pH$ throughout the reaction, but is $\text{midpoint } pH$ at the end, the reactor accepts the word. If not, it does not.</p>
<p>Incidentally, you can interpret this as the <em>enthalpy yield</em>  $Y_{\Delta H} (\%)$ of the computation, defined as
$$
Y_{\Delta H} (\%) = \frac{\text{reaction heat during computation}}{\text{formation heat of input string}} \times 100.
$$
Dyck words <em>maximize</em> the enthalpy yield, whereas all other input sequences with imbalanced numbers of parentheses have lower enthalpy yields. Implication: all PDAs are doing something like "enthalpy maximization" in their computation. Couldn't find a good reference or exposition here, but something to look into.</p>
<p>How do we model Turing machines? You can think of a Turing machine as a "two-stack" PDA, where each stack corresponds to moving left or right on the tape. Physically, this implies that we want to model TMs with a reaction with at least two interdependent intermediaries, and we want it to be "expressive" enough to model "non-linearities". Oscillatory redox reactions are a natural choice, of which the Belousov-Zhabotinsky (BZ) reaction is the most famous.</p>
<p>A typical BZ reaction involves the combination of sodium bromate and malonic acid, with the main structure as follows:
$$
3\text{BrO}_3^- + 3\text{CH}_2(\text{COOH})_2 + 3\text{H}^+ \to 3\text{BrCH}(\text{COOH})_2 + 4\text{CO}_2 + 2\text{HCOOH} + 5\text{H}_2\text{O}.
$$</p>
<p>BZ reactions have <em>a ton</em> of macro-structure. Color changes as a function of the amount of oxidized catalyst, the proportions of the reactants and products fluctuate periodically, and even spatial patterns emerge from micro-heterogeneity in concentrations (e.g. reaction-diffusion waves, Pack patterns). These properties are incredibly interesting in and of themselves, but all we need for modeling TMs is that the reaction is sensitive to the addition of small amounts of aliquot.</p>
<p>Consider the language $L_3 = \{a^nb^nc^n \mid n \geq 0\}.$ Dueñas-Díez and Pérez-Mercader associate the letter $a$ with sodium bromate and $b$ with malonic acid. $c$ must somehow be dependent on the concentrations of $a$ and $b,$ so we associate $c$ with the $pH$ of the one-pot reactor, which we can read with sodium hydroxide. An aliquot of the rubidium catalyst maps to the start-and-end token.</p>
<p>Oscillation frequency $f$ is proportional to $[\text{BrO}_3]^\alpha \times [\text{CH}_2(\text{COOH})_2]^{\beta} \times [\text{NaOH}]^{-\gamma},$ but it can also be modeled as a nonlinear function of the difference between the maximum redox value of the reaction and the mean redox value of a given oscillation, that is:
$$
D = V_{\text{max}} + \left( V_T + \frac{V_P - V_T}{2}\right),
$$
where $V_T$ and $V_P$ are the trough and peak potentials, respectively, and $V_\text{max}$ is the maximum potential. Ultimately, the final frequency of the reaction can be modeled as a quadratic in $D_{\#}$ to high-precision ($\#$ denotes the start-and-end token, so it can be taken to be the last timestep in reaction coordinates).</p>
<p>What actually allows word-by-word identification though, is the sensitivity of the oscillatory patterns to the concentrations of specific intermediaries:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The various "out-of-order" signatures for words not in $L_3$ can be explained as follows. Each symbol has an associated distinct pathway in the reaction network. Hence, if the aliquot added is for the same symbol as the previous one, the pathway is not changed but reinforced. In contrast, when the aliquot is different, the reaction is shifted from one dominant pathway to another pathway, thus reconfiguring the key intermediate concentrations and, in turn, leading to distinctive changes in the oscillatory patterns. The change from one pathway, say 1, to say pathway 2 impacts the oscillations differently than going from pathway 2 to pathway 1. This is what allows the machine to give unique distinctive behaviors for out-of-order substrings.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#1">1</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thermodynamically, characterizing word acceptance is a little bit more involved than that of PDAs or FSAs, but it can still be done. Define the <em>area</em> of a word as
$$
A^{\text(Word)} = V_{\text{max}} + \tau' - \int_{t_{\#} + 30}^{t_{\#} + \tau} V_\text{osc}(t) \, dt,
$$
where $t_{\#}$ is the time in reaction coordinates where the end token is added, $\tau'$ is the time interval between symbols, $V_\text{max}$ is the maximum redox potential, and $V_\text{osc}$ is the measured redox potential by the Nerst equation
$$
V_\text{osc} = V_0 + \frac{RT}{nF} \ln \left( \frac{[Ru(bpy)^{3+}_{3}]}{[Ru(bpy)^{2+}_{3}]} \right),
$$
where $Ru(bpy)^{3+}_{3}$ and $Ru(bpy)^{2+}_{3}$ are the concentrations of the oxidized and reduced catalyst of the BZ reaction, respectively. Now, the Gibbs free energy can be related to the redox potential as so:
$$
\Delta G_\text{osc} = -nFV_\text{osc},
$$
so the area of a word can be rewritten in terms of the free energy as
$$
A^{\text(Word)} = - \frac{1}{n_eF} \left( \Delta G ' \times \tau ' - \int_{t_{\#} + 30}^{t_{\#} + \tau} \Delta G_\text{osc}(t) dt\right).
$$
Accepted words all have some constant value of $A^{\text(Word)},$ while rejected words have a value that is dependent on the word.</p>
<p>$L_3$ is a context-sensitive language, so it is only a member of the Type-1 grammar not the Type-0 grammar. However, for our purposes (realizing some practical implementation of a TM) it is roughly equivalent, as any finite TM can be realized as a two-stack PDA, and this models a two-stack PDA quite well.</p>

                            <p>Broadly, I see three separate threads in this work: an attempt to situate second-wave feminism in a historical context, a pseudo-rehabilitation of Freudianism in service of the sexual dialectic, and an argument for the necessity of reproductive substitutes to achieve true equality.</p>
<p>The first of these, while interesting, is not something I have much to say about. The second primarily exists to justify the third—"exactly because Freud was correct in identifying the psychosexual underpinnings of society,<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#1">1</a></sup> then freedom can only be achieved by eliminating these shackles on mankind." The third germinated the cyberfeminist movement of the 1990s, which itself spawned CCRU and modern accelerationism (via Sadie Plant).</p>
<p>If you adopt this framing, Firestone's choice of the dialectic as a <em>structure</em> is in large part pragmatic, given she is trying to replicate Marx's totalizing analysis of class but as applied to sex. Adopting Freudianism is necessary to ensure that the nature of sex-oppresion <em>subsumes</em> that of class-oppression by establishing exploitation within a nuclear family as a more fundamental primitive than exploitation in the workplace. Race-oppresion is dealt with similarly.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#2">2</a></sup></p>
<p>She is not kind to Western family structure. In a patriarchy, she argues, oppression of women and children are fundamentally intertwined. Both are forced to be physically dependent, sexually repressed, repressed in the family, and repressed in society. Even a mother's love is borne out of a shared helplessness. <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#3">3</a></sup></p>
<p>She is even less kind to love. <em>"For love, perhaps even more than child-bearing, is the pivot of women’s oppression today."</em> Why? Because love allows male culture to parasitically feed off of the emotional strength of women. What should be a love between equals is perverted by its political context and the inevitable power dynamic between husband and wife. Regardless, men can't love. Men are <em>incapable of loving</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#4">4</a></sup></p>
<p>The solution? Free women from the "tyranny of reproduction" with artificial wombs and joint responsibility of the sexes for child-rearing. Give women and children political autonomy via economic independence. Completely integrate women and children into society, and give women and children sexual freedom.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#5">5</a></sup></p>
<p>This "feminist revolution" she conceptualizes is similar in nature to the predicted uprising of the proles, but instead initialized by "cybernetic" innovation and a population explosion. "Cybernetics" (what we would today call AI and automation) would simultaneously eliminate the need for a "transient workforce" (mostly women) and the need for house-labor. The population explosion would necessitate some form of population control, which ought take the place of artificial reproduction. Ergo, the fundamentals would be in place for a feminist revolution.</p>
<p>I love this book. It bites bullets.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#6">6</a></sup> It has novel conceptual insights. It has truth to it. Her intellectual descendants were better off for her having written this, and it gives a transcendent vision rather than an immanent one. She even gives a blueprint for her utopia.</p>
<h2>Quotes</h2>
<div class="footnote-definition" id="1"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">1</sup>
<blockquote>
<p>Other such examples are abundant, but I have made my point: with a feminist analysis the whole structure of Freudianism – for the first time – makes thorough sense, clarifying such important related areas as homosexuality, even the nature of the repressive incest taboo itself – two causally related subjects which have been laboured for a long time with little unanimity. We can understand them, finally, only as symptoms of the power psychology created by the family.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="footnote-definition" id="2"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">2</sup>
<blockquote>
<p>Like sexism in the individual psyche, we can fully understand racism only in terms of the power hierarchies of the family: in the Biblical sense, the races are no more than the various parents and siblings of the Family of Man; and as in the development of sexual classes, the physiological distinction of race became important culturally only due to the unequal distribution of power. <em>Thus, racism is sexism extended.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="footnote-definition" id="3"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">3</sup>
<blockquote>
<p>The mother who wants to kill her child for what she has had to sacrifice for it (a common desire) learns to love that same child only when she understands that it is as helpless, as oppressed as she is, and by the same oppressor: then her hatred is directed outwards, and 'mother-love' is born.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="footnote-definition" id="4"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">4</sup>
<blockquote>
<p>It is dangerous to feel sorry for one's oppressor – women are especially prone to this failing – but I am tempted to do it in this case. Being unable to love is hell. This is the way it proceeds: as soon as the man feels any pressure from the other partner to commit himself, he panics. . .</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="footnote-definition" id="5"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">5</sup>
<blockquote>
<p>But in our new society, humanity could finally revert to its natural polymorphous sexuality – all forms of sexuality would be allowed and indulged. The fully sexuate mind, realized in the past in only a few individuals (survivors), would become universal. Artificial cultural achievement would no longer be the only avenue to sexuate self-realization: one could now realize oneself fully, simply in the process of being and acting.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="footnote-definition" id="6"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">6</sup>
<blockquote>
<p>In this view, the later Russian reinstitution of the nuclear family system is seen as a last-ditch attempt to salvage humanist values – privacy, individualism, love, etc., by then rapidly disappearing.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p>But it is the reverse: <em>the failure of the Russian Revolution to achieve the classless society is traceable to its half-hearted attempts to eliminate the family and sexual repression.</em> This failure, in turn, was due to the limitations of a male-biased revolutionary analysis based on economic class alone, one that failed to take the family fully into account even in its function as an economic unit. By the same token, <em>all socialist revolutions to date have been or will be failures for precisely these reasons.</em></p>

                            <h2><a href="https://yudhister.me/species/">Species as Canonical Referents of Super-Organisms</a></h2>

                            <p>A species is a reproductively isolated population. In essence, it consists of organisms which can only breed with each other, so its ability to self-replicate is entirely self-contained. In practice, the abstraction only applies well to macroflora and macrofauna, which is still enough to inform our intuitions of super-organismal interaction.</p>
<p>Interspecific interactions can frequently be modeled by considering the relevant species as agents in their own right. Agents motivated by self-sustention to acquire resources, preserve the health of their subagents, and bargain or compete with others on the same playing field as themselves. Parasitism, predation, pollination—all organismal interactions generalizable to super-organismal interactions.</p>
<p>Optimization of the genome does not occur at the level of the organism, nor does it occur at the level of the tribe. It occurs on the level of the genome, and selects for genes which encode traits which are more fit. From this perspective, it makes sense for "species" to be a natural abstraction. Yet, I claim there are properties which species have that make them particularly nice examples of super-organisms in action. Namely:</p>
<ul>
<li>Boundaries between species are clear and well-defined, due to reproductive isolation;</li>
<li>Competitive dynamics between species are natural to consider, rather than having to move up or down a vertical hierarchy;</li>
<li>The "intentional stance", when applied to species, is simple: reproduction.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, it is precisely because species have such nice properties that we should be incredibly cautious when using them as intuition pumps for other kinds of super-organisms, such as nation-states, companies, or egregores. For instance:</p>
<ul>
<li>Boundaries between nation-states and companies are relatively straightforward to define (determined by citizenship or residency and employment, respectively). Boundaries between egregores are . . . complicated, to say the least.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#1">1</a></sup></li>
<li>Company competition is generally modelable with agent-agent dynamics, and so is nation-state competition. But the act of "merging" (via acquisition, immigration, etc.) is available to them in a way that it is not to species. (Again, egregores are complicated . . .)</li>
<li>The goal of a company is to maximize shareholder value. The goal of a nation-state is . . . to provide value to its citizens? The "goal" of an egregore is ostensibly to self-perpetuate and . . . fullfill whichever values it wants to fulfill.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#2">2</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<p>These "issues" are downstream from horizontal boundaries between other super-organisms we want to consider being less strong than the divides between idealized species. While Schelling was able to develop doctines of mutually-assured destruction for Soviet-American relations, many other nation-state interactions are heavily mediated by immigration and economic intertwinement. It makes less sense to separate China and America than it does to separate foxes and rabbits.</p>
<p>Don't species run into the same issues as well? Humans are all members of one species, and we manage to have absurd amounts of intraspecial conflict. Similarly, tribal dynamics in various populations are often net negative for the population as a whole. Why shall we uphold species as the canonical referent for superorganisms?</p>
<p>Species are self-sustaining and isolated. The platonic ideal of a species would not only be reproductively isolated, but also resource isolated, in that the only use for the resources which organisms of a species would need to thrive were ones which were unusable for any other purpose. Horizontal differentiation is necessary to generalize agent modeling to systems larger than ourselves, and species possess a kind of horizontal differentiation which is important and powerful.</p>
<p>A corollary of this observation is that insofar as our intuitions for "superorganismal interaction" are based on species-to-species interaction, they should be tuned to the extent to which the superorganisms we have in mind are similar to species. AI-human interaction in worlds where AIs have completely different hardware substrates to humans are notably distinct from ones in which humans have high-bandwidth implants and <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/jTiSWHKAtnyA723LE/overview-of-strong-human-intelligence-amplification-methods">absurd cognitive enhancement</a>, so they can engage in <a href="https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/bxt7uCiHam4QXrQAA/cyborgism">more symbiotic relationships</a>.</p>
<p>I would be interested in fleshing out these ideas more rigorously, either in the form of case studies or via a debate. If you are interested, feel free to reach out.</p>

<div class="footnote-definition" id="1"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">1</sup>
<p>One way to establish a boundary between two categories is to define properties which apply to some class of objects which could be sorted into one of the two buckets. But what is the "class of objects" which egregores encompass?! Shall we define a "unit meme" now?</p>
</div>
<div class="footnote-definition" id="2"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">2</sup>
<p>I'm aware I'm not fully doing justice to egregores here. I still include them as an example of a "superorganism" because they do describe something incredibly powerful. E.g., explaining phenomena where individuals acting in service of an ideology collectively contravene their own interests.</p>
