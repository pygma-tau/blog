                            <time datetime="2024-06-30">June 30, 2024</time>
                        </header>
                        <div class="post-content">
                            <p>The Probabilistic Payor's Lemma implies the following cooperation strategy:</p>
<p>Let $A_{1}, \ldots, A_{n}$ be agents in a multiplayer Prisoner's Dilemma, with the ability to return either 'Cooperate' or 'Defect' (which we model as the agents being logical statements resolving to either 'True' or 'False').  Each $A_{i}$ behaves as follows:</p>
<p>$$
, \vdash \Box_{p_{i}} \left( \Box_{\max {p_{1},\ldots, p_{n}}}\bigwedge_{k=1}^n A_{k} \to \bigwedge_{k=1}^n A_{k} \right) \to A_{i}
$$</p>
<p>Where $p_i$ represents each individual agents' threshold for cooperation (as a probability in $[0,1]$), $\Box_p , \phi$ returns True if credence in the statement $\phi$ is greater than $p,$ and the conjunction of $A_{1}, \ldots, A_{n}$ represents 'everyone cooperates'. Then, by the PPL, all agents cooperate, provided that all $\mathbb{P}_{A_{i}}$ give credence to the cooperation statement greater than each and every $A_{i}$'s individual thresholds for cooperation.</p>
<p>This formulation is desirable for a number of reasons: firstly, the Payor's Lemma is much simpler to prove than Lob's Theorem, and doesn't carry with it the same strange consequences as a result of asserting an arbitrary modal-fixedpoint; second, when we relax the necessitation requirement from 'provability' to 'belief', this gives us behavior much more similar to how agents actually I read it as it emphasizing the notion of 'evidence' being important.</p>
<p>However, the consistency of this 'p-belief' modal operator rests on the self-referential probabilistic logic proposed by Christiano 2012, which, while being consistent, has a few undesirable properties: the distribution over sentences automatically assigns probability 1 to all True statements and 0 to all False ones (meaning it can only really model uncertainty for statements not provable within the system).</p>
<p>I propose that we can transfer the intuitions we have from probabilistic modal logic to a setting where 'p-belief' is analogous to calling a 'reflective oracle', and this system gets us similar (or identical) properties of cooperation.</p>
<h2>Oracles</h2>
<p>A <em>probabilistic oracle</em> $O$ is a function from $\mathbb{N} \to [0,1]^\mathbb{N}.$ Here, its domain is meant to represent an indexing of <em>probabilistic oracle machines,</em> which are simply Turing machines allowed to call an oracle for input. An oracle can be queried with tuples of the form $(M, p),$ where $M$ is a probabilistic oracle machine and $p$ is a rational number between 0 and 1. By Fallenstein et. al. 2015, there exists a <em>reflective oracle</em> on each set of queries such that $O(M,p) = 1$ if $\mathbb{P}(M() = 1) &gt; p,$ and $O(M,p) = 0$ if $\mathbb{P}(M() = 0) &lt; 1-p$ (check this).</p>
<p>Notice that a reflective oracle has similar properties to the $Bel$ operator in self-referential probabilistic logic. It has a coherent probability distribution over probabilistic oracle machines (as opposed to sentences), it only gives information about the probability to arbitrary precision via queries ($O(M,p)$ vs. $Bel(\phi)$). So, it would be great if there was a canonical method of relating the two.</p>
<p>Peano Arithmetic is Turing-complete, there exists a method of embedding arbitrary Turing machines in statements in predicate logic and there also exist various methods for embedding Turing machines in PA. We can form a correspondence where implications are preserved: notably, $x\to y$ simply represents the program <code>if TM(x), then TM(y)</code> , and negations just make the original TM output 1 where it outputted 0 and vice versa.</p>
<p>(Specifically, we're identifying non-halting Turing machines with propositions and operations on those propositions with different ways of composing the component associated Turing machines. Roughly, a Turing machine outputting 1 on an input is equivalent to a given sentence being true on that input)</p>
<p>CDT, expected utility maximizing agents with access to the same reflective oracle will reach Nash equilibria, because reflective oracles can <em>model other oracles</em> and <em>other oracles that are called by other probabilistic oracle machines</em>---so, at least in the unbounded setting, we don't have to worry about infinite regresses, because the oracles are guaranteed to halt.</p>
<p>So, we can consider the following bot:
$$
A_{i} := O_{i} \left( O_{\bigcap i} \left( \bigwedge_{k=1}^n A_{k}\right) \to \bigwedge_{k=1}^n A_{k}, , p_{i}\right),
$$
where $A_i$ is an agent represented by a oracle machine, $O_i$ is the probabilistic oracle affiliated with the agent, $O_{\bigcap i}$ is the closure of all agents' oracles, and $p_{i} \in \mathbb{Q} \cap [0,1]$ is an individual probability threshold set by each agent.</p>
<p>How do we get these closures? Well, ideally $O_{\bigcap i}$ returns $0$ for queries $(M,p)$ if $p &lt; \min{p_{M_1}, \ldots, p_{M_n}}$ and $1$ if $p &gt; \max {p_{M_1}, \ldots, p_{M_n}},$ and randomizes for queries in the middle---for the purposes of this cooperation strategy, this turns out to work.</p>
<p>I claim this set of agents has the same behavior as those acting in accordance with the PPL: they will all cooperate if the 'evidence' for cooperating is above each agents' individual threshold $p_i.$ In the previous case, the 'evidence' was the statement $\Box_{\max {p_{1},\ldots, p_{n}}}\bigwedge_{k=1}^n A_{k} \to \bigwedge_{k=1}^n A_{k}.$ Here, the evidence is the statement $O_{\bigcap i} \left( \bigwedge_{k=1}^n A_{k}\right) \to \bigwedge_{k=1}^n A_{k}.$</p>
<p>To flesh out the correspondence further, we can show that the relevant properties of the $p$-belief operator are found in reflective oracles as well: namely, that instances of the weak distribution axiom schema are coherent and that necessitation holds.</p>
<p>For necessitation, $\vdash \phi \implies \vdash \Box_{p}\phi$ turns into $M_{\phi}() = 1$ implying that $O(M_{\phi},p)=1,$ which is true by the properties of reflective oracles. For weak distributivity, $\vdash \phi \to \psi \implies \vdash \Box_{p} \phi \to \Box_{p}\psi$ can be analogized to 'if it is true that the Turing machine associated with $\phi$ outputs 1 implies that the Turing machine associated with $\psi$ outputs 1, then you should be at least $\phi$-certain that $\psi$-outputs 1, so $O(M_{\phi},p)$ should imply $O(M_{\psi}, p)$ in all cases (because oracles represent true properties of probabilistic oracle machines, which Turing machines can be embedded into).</p>
<h2>Models</h2>
<p>Moreover, we can consider oracles to be a rough model of the p-belief modal language in which the probabilistic Payor's Lemma holds. We can get an explicit model to ensure consistency (see the links with Christiano's system, as well as its interpretation in neighborhood semantics), but oracles seem like a good intuition pump because they actively admit queries of the same form as $Bel(\phi)&gt;p,$ and they are a nice computable analog.</p>
<p>They're a bit like the probabilistic logic in the sense that a typical reflective oracle just has full information about what the output of a Turing machine will be if it halts, and the probabilistic logic gives $\mathbb{P}(\phi)=1$ to all sentences which are deducible from the set of tautologies in the language. So the correspondence has some meat.</p>

                            <p>Christianity rose because:</p>
<ul>
<li>it became popular amongst the middle &amp; upper classes,</li>
<li>it gave Hellenized Jews a chance to fuse their Hellenic and Jewish identities, and Hellenic Jews were a substantial portion of the population,</li>
<li>it was better than paganism at letting Romans cope with the epidemics of the 2nd century, and also encouraged charity that massively improved the survival rate of those with closer connection to Christians via nurisng etc.,</li>
<li>it was more popular amongst women because it discouraged abortion &amp; infanticide and promoted mutual chastity till marriage, and as a result early in the Christian movement # women &gt;&gt; # men (correlated with/caused greater freedom for women),</li>
<li>Greco-Roman cities were atrocious, horrifying, and disgusting---Christianity was primarily an urban movement, so is it really surprising that it took root where hopelessness would probably have been the highest?</li>
<li>early Christians had a lot of skin in the game (exemplified by the martyrs of the 60s), making the religion extremely potent &amp; able to give benefits exceeding that of paganism to their believers</li>
<li>above all, Christianity is virtuous, and virtue wins.</li>
</ul>
<p>Smattering of useful frames here: sect vs. cult movements (sect movements being offshoots and having a base from which to draw from, cult movements being new sprouts and fringe and ostracized in the beginning), not-very-rigorous models that involve a lot of assumptions can be surprisingly accurate (see: Fermi, see: this book's estimation of travel distance from Jerusalem), martyrdom as central to Christian belief, and Christianity as (in some ways) this weird bastard child of Roman paganism and Jewish monotheism.</p>
<p>Apparently Roman cities were 1.5x-2x as dense as Indian cities are today, without the ability to build upwards. Also apparently, the racial mixing in the Roman empire was as if the entirety of the British empire was squashed together with freedom of movement. Strangely ancap?</p>
<p>It won because it was the better tech. Jesus was the ultimate startup founder</p>

                            <p>A post-apocalyptic fever dream. The oldest civilized metropolis. Where sons are pathetic in the eyes of their father, and both are pathetic in the eyes of their grandfathers—all while wearing blackened sunglasses and leather jackets. Grown, not made.</p>
<p>Rome is, perhaps, the first place I recognized as solely for visiting, never living. Unlike Tokyo, one feels this immediately. Japan’s undesirability stems primarily from its inordinate, sprawling bureaucracy that is, for the most part, hidden from the typical visitor. Rome’s undesirability is apparent for all to see—it’s loud, stifling, unmaintained, and requires arduous traversals.</p>
<p>Population c. 100 C.E.: 1 million people.<br />
Population c. 1000 C.E.: 35,000.<br />
Population c. 2024 C.E.: 2.8 million people.</p>
<p>Rebound? Not so fast—the global population in the year 100 was just 200 million.</p>
<p>And this is obvious. The city center is still dominated by the Colosseum, the Imperial fora, and Trajan’s Market. Only the Vittoriano holds a candle to their extant glory. Yet the hordes of tourists still walk down the Via dei Forti Imperiali and congregate in stupidly long lines at the ticket booth to see ruins!</p>
<p>I walked across the city from east to west, passing by a secondary school, flea market, and various patisseries (is that the correct wording?). The pastries were incredible. The flea market reminded me of Mexico, interestingly enough. Felt very Catholic.</p>
<p>(All the buses and trams run late in Rome. This too, is very Catholic, as Orwell picked up on during his time in Catalonia and as anyone visiting a Mexican house would know. Plausibly also Irish?)</p>
<p>Rome’s ivies pervade its structures. Villas, monuments, churches (all 900 of them), and fountains all fall victim to these creepers. It gives the perception of a ruined city, that Roman glory has come and gone—and when one is aware of Italian history, it is very, very hard to perceive Rome as anything else than an overgrown still-surviving bastion against the continuing spirit of the Vandals.</p>
<p>Roman pines, too, are fungiform. Respighi’s tone poem doesn’t do justice to them. Perhaps this is just a Mediterranean vibe? But amongst the monumental Classical, Romanesque, and Neoclassical structures of the Piazza Venezia, these pines are punctual. Don’t really know how else to convey it.</p>
<p>It is difficult to comprehend how the animalistic, gladitorial Roman society became the seat of the Catholic Church. This city is clearly Gaian, and clearly ruled by the very same gods their Pantheon pays homage to. The Christian God is not of nature, it is apart from nature. It is not Dionysian, it is not even Apollonian (because it cannot recognize or respect the Dionysian, and as such cannot exist in context of it, only apart from it). And yet, the Pope persists.</p>
<p>I have not seen the Vatican yet. I want to. I will be back.</p>

This gives us modal fixed-point-esque group cooperation even under probabilistic guarantees.</em></p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p><strong>Payor's Lemma:</strong> If $\vdash \Box (\Box x \to x) \to x,$ then $\vdash x.$</p>
<p>We assume two rules of inference:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Necessitation:</strong> $\vdash x \implies \vdash \Box x,$</li>
<li><strong>Distributivity:</strong> $\vdash \Box(x \to y) \implies \vdash \Box x \to \Box y.$</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Proof:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>$\vdash x \to (\Box x \to x),$ by tautology;</li>
<li>$\vdash \Box x \to \Box (\Box x \to x),$ by 1 via necessitation and distributivity;</li>
<li>$\vdash \Box (\Box x \to x) \to x$, by assumption;</li>
<li>$\vdash \Box x \to x,$ from 2 and 3 by modus ponens;</li>
<li>$\vdash \Box (\Box x \to x),$ from 4 by necessitation;</li>
<li>$\vdash x,$ from 5 and 3 by modus ponens.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Payor's Lemma is provable in all normal modal logics (as it can be proved in $K,$ the weakest, because it only uses necessitation and distributivity). Its proof sidesteps the assertion of an arbitrary modal fixedpoint, does not require internal necessitation ($\vdash \Box x \implies \vdash \Box \Box x$), and provides the groundwork  for Lobian handshake-based cooperation without Lob's theorem.</p>
<p>It is known that Lob's theorem <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/oBDTMnEzptBidvmw7/probabilistic-loeb-theorem">fails to hold in reflective theories of logical uncertainty</a>. However, a <a href="https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/ZWhJcHPmRaXAPAK5k/probabilistic-payor-lemma">proof of a probabilistic Payor's lemma</a> has been proposed, which modifies the rules of inference necessary to be:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Necessitation:</strong> $\vdash x \implies \vdash \Box_p , x,$</li>
<li><strong>Weak Distributivity:</strong> $\vdash x \to y \implies \vdash \Box_p , x \to \Box_p , y.$
where here we take $\Box_p$ to be an operator which returns True if the internal credence of $x$ is greater than $p$ and False if not. (Formalisms incoming).</li>
</ul>
<p>The question is then: does there exist a consistent formalism under which these rules of inference hold? The answer is yes, and it is provided by <a href="http://intelligence.org/files/DefinabilityTruthDraft.pdf">Christiano 2012</a>.</p>
<h2>Setup</h2>
<p>(Regurgitation and rewording of the relevant parts of the <a href="http://intelligence.org/files/DefinabilityTruthDraft.pdf">Definability of Truth</a>)</p>
<p>Let $L$ be some language and $T$ be a theory over that language. Assume that $L$ is powerful enough to admit a Godel encoding and that it contains terms which correspond to the rational numbers $\mathbb{Q}.$ Let $\phi_1, \phi_{2} \ldots$ be some fixed enumeration of all sentences in $L.$ Let $\ulcorner \phi \urcorner$ represent the Godel encoding of $\phi.$</p>
<p>We are interested in the existence and behavior of a function $\mathbb{P}: L \to [0,1]^L,$ which assigns a real-valued probability in $[0,1]$ to each well-formed sentence of $L.$ We are guaranteed the coherency of $\mathbb{P}$ with the following assumptions:</p>
<ol>
<li>For all $\phi, \psi \in L$ we have that $\mathbb{P}(\phi) = \mathbb{P}(\phi \land \psi) + \mathbb{P}(\phi \lor \neg \psi).$</li>
<li>For each tautology $\phi,$ we have $\mathbb{P}(\phi) = 1.$</li>
<li>For each contradiction $\phi,$ we have $\mathbb{P}(\phi) = 0.$</li>
</ol>
<p>Note: I think that 2 &amp; 3 are redundant (as says John Baez), and that these axioms do not necessarily constrain $\mathbb{P}$ to $[0,1]$ in and of themselves (hence the extra restriction). However, neither concern is relevant to the result.</p>
<p>A coherent $\mathbb{P}$ corresponds to a distribution $\mu$ over models of $L.$ A coherent $\mathbb{P}$ which gives probability 1 to $T$ corresponds to a distribution $\mu$ over models of $T$. We denote a function which generates a distribution over models of a given theory $T$ as $\mathbb{P}_T.$</p>
<p><strong>Syntactic-Probabilistic Correspondence:</strong> Observe that $\mathbb{P}_T(\phi) =1 \iff T \vdash \phi.$ This allows us to interchange the notions of syntactic consequence and probabilistic certainty.</p>
<p>Now, we want $\mathbb{P}$ to give sane probabilities to sentences which talk about the probability $\mathbb{P}$ gives them. This means that we need some way of giving $L$ the ability to talk about itself.</p>
<p>Consider the formula $Bel.$ $Bel$ takes as input the Godel encodings of sentences. $Bel(\ulcorner \phi \urcorner)$ contains <em>arbitrarily precise</em> information about $\mathbb{P}(\phi).$ In other words, if $\mathbb{P}(\phi) = p,$ then the statement $Bel(\ulcorner \phi \urcorner) &gt; a$ is True for all $a &lt; p,$ and the statement $Bel(\ulcorner \phi \urcorner) &gt; b$ is False for all $b &gt; p.$ $Bel$ is fundamentally <em>a part</em> of the system, as opposed to being some metalanguage concept.</p>
<p>(These are identical properties to that represented in Christiano 2012 by $\mathbb{P}(\ulcorner \phi \urcorner).$ I simply choose to represent $\mathbb{P}(\ulcorner \phi \urcorner)$ with $Bel(\ulcorner \phi \urcorner)$ as it (1) reduces notational uncertainty and (2) seems to be more in the spirit of Godel's $Bew$ for provability logic).</p>
<p>Let $L'$ denote the language created by affixing $Bel$ to $L.$ Then, there exists a coherent $\mathbb{P}_T$ for a given consistent theory $T$ over $L$ such that the following reflection principle is satisfied:</p>
<p>$$
\forall \phi \in L' ; \forall a,b \in \mathbb{Q} : (a &lt; \mathbb{P}<em>{T}(\phi) &lt; b) \implies \mathbb{P}</em>{T}(a &lt; Bel(\ulcorner \phi \urcorner) &lt; b) = 1.
$$</p>
<p>In other words, $a &lt; \mathbb{P}_T(\phi) &lt; b$ implies $T \vdash a &lt; Bel(\ulcorner \phi \urcorner) &lt; b.$</p>
<h2>Proof</h2>
<p>(From now, for simplicity, we use $\mathbb{P}$ to refer to $\mathbb{P}_T$ and $\vdash$ to refer to $T \vdash.$ You can think of this as fixing some theory $T$ and operating within it).</p>
<p>Let $\Box_p , (\phi)$ represent the sentence $Bel(\ulcorner \phi \urcorner) &gt; p,$ for some $p \in \mathbb{Q}.$ We abbreviate $\Box_p , (\phi)$ as $\Box_p , \phi.$ Then, we have the following:</p>
<p><strong>Probabilistic Payor's Lemma:</strong> If $\vdash \Box_p , (\Box_p , x \to x) \to x,$ then $\vdash x.$</p>
<p><strong>Proof</strong> <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ZWhJcHPmRaXAPAK5k/probabilistic-payor-lemma">as per Demski</a>:</p>
<ol>
<li>$\vdash x \to (\Box_{p},x \to x),$ by tautology;</li>
<li>$\vdash \Box_{p}, x \to \Box_{p}, (\Box_{p}, x \to x),$ by 1 via weak distributivity,</li>
<li>$\vdash \Box_{p} (\Box_{p} , x \to x) \to x$, by assumption;</li>
<li>$\vdash \Box_{p} , x \to x,$ from 2 and 3 by modus ponens;</li>
<li>$\vdash \Box_{p}, (\Box_{p}, x \to x),$ from 4 by necessitation;</li>
<li>$\vdash x,$ from 5 and 3 by modus ponens.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Rules of Inference:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Necessitation:</strong> $\vdash x \implies \vdash \Box_p , x.$ If $\vdash x,$ then $\mathbb{P}(x) = 1$ by syntactic-probabilistic correspondence, so by the reflection principle we have $\mathbb{P}(\Box_p , x) = 1,$ and as such $\vdash \Box_p , x$ by syntactic-probabilistic correspondence.</p>
<p><strong>Weak Distributivity:</strong> $\vdash x \to y \implies \vdash \Box_p , x \to \Box_p , y.$ The proof of this is slightly more involved.</p>
<p>From $\vdash x \to y$ we have (via correspondence) that $\mathbb{P}(x \to y) = 1,$ so $\mathbb{P}(\neg x \lor y) = 1.$ We want to prove that $\mathbb{P}(\Box_p , x \to \Box_p , y) = 1$ from this, or $\mathbb{P}((Bel(\ulcorner x \urcorner) \leq p) \lor (Bel(\ulcorner y \urcorner) &gt; p)) = 1.$ We can do casework on $x$. If $\mathbb{P}(x) \leq p,$ then weak distributivity follows from vacuousness. If $\mathbb{P}(x) &gt;p,$ then as
$$
\begin{align*}<br />
\mathbb{P}(\neg x \lor y) &amp;= \mathbb{P}(x \land(\neg x \lor y)) + \mathbb{P}(\neg x \land (\neg x \lor y)), \\<br />
1 &amp;= \mathbb{P}(x \land y) + \mathbb{P}(\neg x \lor (\neg x \land y)), \\
1 &amp;= \mathbb{P}(x \land y) + \mathbb{P}(\neg x),
\end{align*}
$$
$\mathbb{P}(\neg x) &lt; 1-p,$ so $\mathbb{P}(x \land y) &lt; p,$ and therefore $\mathbb{P}(y) &gt; p.$ Then, $Bel(\ulcorner y \urcorner) &gt; p$ is True by reflection, so by correspondence it follows that $\vdash \Box_p , x \to \Box_p y.$</p>
<p>(I'm pretty sure this modal logic, following necessitation and weak distributivity, is not normal (it's weaker than $K$). This may have some implications? But in the 'agent' context I don't think that restricting ourselves to modal logics makes sense).</p>
<h2>Bots</h2>
<p>Consider agents $A,B,C$ which return True to signify cooperation in a multi-agent Prisoner's Dilemma and False to signify defection. (Similar setup to <a href="https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/2WpPRrqrFQa6n2x3W/modal-fixpoint-cooperation-without-loeb-s-theorem">Critch's</a> ). Each agent has 'beliefs' $\mathbb{P}_A, \mathbb{P}_B, \mathbb{P}_C : L \to [0,1]^L$ representing their credences over all formal statements in their respective languages (we are assuming they share the same language: this is unnecessary).</p>
<p>Each agent has the ability to reason about their own 'beliefs' about the world arbitrarily precisely, and this allows them full knowledge of their utility function (if they are VNM agents, and up to the complexity of the world-states they can internally represent). Then, these agents can be modeled with Christiano's probabilistic logic! And I would argue it is natural to do so (you could easily imagine an agent having access to its own beliefs with arbitrary precision by, say, repeatedly querying its own preferences).</p>
<p>Then, if $A,B,C$ each behave in the following manner:</p>
<ul>
<li>$\vdash \Box_a , (\Box_e , E \to E) \to A,$</li>
<li>$\vdash  \Box_b , (\Box_e , E \to E) \to B,$</li>
<li>$\vdash \Box_c , (\Box_e , E \to E) \to C,$</li>
</ul>
<p>where $E = A \land B \land C$ and $e = \max ({ a,b,c }),$ they will cooperate by the probabilistic Payor's lemma.</p>
<p><strong>Proof:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>$\vdash \Box_a , (\Box_e , E \to E) \land \Box_b , (\Box_e , E \to E) \land \Box_c , (\Box_e , E \to E) \to A \land B \land C,$ via conjunction;</li>
<li>$\vdash \Box_e , (\Box_e , E \to E) \to E,$ as if the $e$-threshold is satisfied all others are as well;</li>
<li>$\vdash E,$ by probabilistic Payor.</li>
</ol>
<p>This can be extended to arbitrarily many agents. Moreso, the valuable insight here is that cooperation is achieved <em>when the evidence that the group cooperates exceeds each and every member's individual threshold for cooperation.</em> A formalism of the intuitive strategy 'I will only cooperate if there are no defectors' (or perhaps 'we will only cooperate if there are no defectors').</p>
<p>It is important to note that any $\mathbb{P}$ is going to be uncomputable. However, I think modeling agents as having arbitrary access to their beliefs is in line with existing 'ideal' models (think VNM -- I suspect that this formalism closely maps to VNM agents that have access to arbitrary information about their utility function, at least in the form of preferences), and these agents play well with modal fixedpoint cooperation.</p>

<p>And what are these Fluxions? The Velocities of evanescent Increments? And what are these same evanescent Increments? They are neither finite Quantities nor Quantities infinitely small, nor yet nothing. May we not call them the ghosts of departed quantities?</p>
<p>George Berkeley, <em>The Analyst</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>When calculus was invented, it didn't make sense. Newton and Leibniz played fast and dirty with mathematical rigor to develop methods that arrived at the correct answers, but no one knew why. It took another one and a half centuries for Cauchy and Weierstrass develop analysis, and in the meantime people like Berkeley refused to accept the methods utilizing these "ghosts of departed quantities."</p>
<p>Cauchy's and Weierstrass's solution to the crisis of calculus was to define infinitesimals in terms of limits. In other words, to not describe the behavior of functions directly acting on infinitesimals, but rather to frame the the entire endeavour as studying the behaviors of certain operations in the limit, in that weird superposition of being arbitrarily close to something yet not it.</p>
<p>(And here I realize that math is better shown, not told)</p>
<p>The limit of a function \(f(x)\)at \(x=a\) is \(L\) if for any \(\epsilon&gt;0\) there exists some \(\delta &gt; 0\) such that if </p>
<p>\[|x-a|&lt;\delta,\]</p>
<p> then </p>
<p>\[|f(x)-L|&lt;\epsilon.\]</p>
<p>Essentially, the limit exists if there's some value \(\delta\) that forces \(f(x)\) to be within \(\epsilon\) of \(L\) if \(x\) is within \(\delta\) of \(a\). Note that this has to hold true for all \(\epsilon\), and you choose \(\epsilon\) first!</p>
<p>From this we get the well-known definition of the derivative: </p>
<p>\[f'(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}\]</p>
<p> and you can define the integral similarly.</p>
<p>The limit solved calculus's rigor problem. From the limit the entire field of analysis was invented and placed on solid ground, and this foundation has stood to this day.</p>
<p>Yet, it seems like we lose something important when we replace the idea of the "infinitesimally small" with the "arbitrarily close to." Could we actually make numbers that were <em>infinitely small?</em></p>
<h2>The Sequence Construction</h2>
<p>Imagine some mathematical object that had all the relevant properties of the real numbers (addition, multiplication are associative and commutative, is closed, etc.) but had infinitely small and infinitely large numbers. What does this object look like?</p>
<p>We can take the set of all infinite sequences of real numbers \(\mathbb{R}^\mathbb{N}\) as a starting point. A typical element \(a\in\mathbb{R}^\mathbb{N}\) would be </p>
<p>\[a = (a_0, , a_1, , a_2, \ldots)\]</p>
<p> where \(a_0, a_1, a_2, \ldots\) is some infinite sequence of real numbers.</p>
<p>We can define addition and multiplication element-wise as: </p>
<p>\[a + b = (a_{0} + b_{0}, , a_{1} + b_{1}, a_{2} + b_{2}, \ldots),\]</p>
<p>\[a \cdot b = (a_0 \cdot b_0, a_1 \cdot b_1, a_2 \cdot b_2, \ldots).\]</p>
<p>You can verify that this is a commutative ring, which means that these operations behave nicely. Yet, being a commutative ring is not the same thing as being an ordered field, which is what we eventually want if our desired object is to have the same properties as the reals.</p>
<p>To get from \(\mathbb{R}^\mathbb{N}\) to a field structure, we have to modify it to accommodate well-defined division. The typical way of doing this is looking at how to introduce the zero product property: i.e. ensuring that if \(a,b \in \mathbb{R}^\mathbb{N}\) then if \(ab = 0\) either one of \(a,b\) is \(0\).</p>
<p>If we let \(0\) be the sequence of all zeros \((0,0,0,\ldots)\) in \(\mathbb{R}^\mathbb{N},\) then it is clear that we can have two non-zero elements multiply to get zero. If we have </p>
<p>\[a = (a, 0, 0, 0, \ldots),\]</p>
<p> and </p>
<p>\[b = (0,b,b,b, \ldots),\]</p>
<p> then neither of these are the zero element, yet their product is zero.</p>
<p>How do we fix this? Equivalence classes!</p>
<p>Our problem is that there are too many distinct "zero-like" things in the ring of real numbered sequences. Intuitively, we should expect the sequence \((0,1,0,0,\ldots)\) to be <em>basically</em> zero, and we want to find a good condensation of \(\mathbb{R}^\mathbb{N}\) that allows for this.</p>
<p>In other words, how do we make all the sequences with "<a href="https://www.ykumar.org/almost-always/">almost all</a>" their elements as zero to be equal to zero?</p>
<h2>Almost All Agreement ft. Ultrafilters</h2>
<p>Taken from "<a href="https://www.ykumar.org/almost-always/">five ways to say "Almost Always" and actually mean it</a>":</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A <em>filter</em> \(\mathcal{F}\) on an arbitrary set \(I\) is a collection of subsets of \(I\) that is closed under set intersections and supersets. (Note that this means that the smallest filter on \(I\) is \(I\) itself).</p>
<p>An <em>ultrafilter</em> is a filter which, for every \(A \subseteq I\), contains either \(A\) or its complement. A <em>principal</em> ultrafilter contains a finite set.</p>
<p>A <em>nonprincipal ultrafilter</em> does not.</p>
<p>This turns out to be an incredibly powerful mathematical tool, and can be used to generalize the concept of "almost all" to esoteric mathematical objects that might not have well-defined or intuitive properties.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let's say we define some nonprincipal ultrafilter \(\mathcal{U}\) on the natural numbers. This will contain all cofinite sets, and will exclude all finite sets. Now, let's take two sequences \(a,b \in \mathbb{R}^\mathbb{N},\) and define their <em>agreement set</em> \(I\) to be the indices on which \(a,b\) are identical (have the same real number in the same position).</p>
<p>Observe that \(I\) is a set of natural numbers. If \(I \in \mathcal{U},\) then \(I\) cannot be finite, and it seems pretty obvious that almost all the elements in \(a,b\) are the same (they only disagree at a finite number of places after all). Conversely, if \(I \not\in \mathcal{U},\) this implies that \(\mathbb{N}/I \in \mathcal{U}\), which means that \(a,b\) disagree at almost all positions, so they probably shouldn't be equal.</p>
<p>Voila! We have a suitable definition of "almost all agreement": if the agreement set \(I\) is contained in some arbitrary nonprincipal ultrafilter \(\mathcal{U}\).</p>
<p>Let \(^*\mathbb{R}\) be the quotient set of \(\mathbb{R}^\mathbb{N}\) under this equivalence relation (essentially, the set of all distinct equivalence classes of \(\mathbb{R}^\mathbb{N}\)). Does this satisfy the zero product property?</p>
<p>(Notation note: we will let \((a)\) denote the infinite sequence of the real number \(a\), and \([a]\) the equivalence class of the sequence \((a)\) in \(^* \mathbb{R}\).)</p>
<h2>Yes, This Behaves Like The Real Numbers</h2>
<p>Let \(a,b \in \mathbb{R}^\mathbb{N}\) such that \(ab = (0)\). Let's break this down element-wise: either \(a_n, b_n\) must be zero for all \(n \in \mathbb{N}.\) As one of the ultrafilter axioms is that it must contain a set or its complement, either the index set of the zero elements in \(a\) or the index set of the zero elements in \(b\) will be in any nonprincipal ultrafilter on \(\mathbb{N}.\) Therefore, either \(a\) or \(b\) is equivalent to \((0)\) in \(^* \mathbb{R},\) so \(^* \mathbb{R}\) satisfies the zero product property.</p>
<p>Therefore, division is well defined on \(^<em>\mathbb{R}\)! Now all we need is an ordering, and luckily almost all agreement saves the day again. We can say for \(a,b \in ^</em>\mathbb{R}\) that \(a&gt;b\) if almost all elements in \(a\) are greater than the elements in \(b\) at the same positions (using the same ultrafilter equivalence).</p>
<p>So, \(^*\mathbb{R}\) is an ordered field!</p>
<h2>Infinitesimals and Infinitely Large Numbers</h2>
<p>We have the following hyperreal:</p>
<p>\[\epsilon = \left( 1, \frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{3}, \ldots, \frac{1}{n}, \ldots \right).\]</p>
<p>Recall that we embed the real numbers into the hyperreals by assigning every real number \(a\) to the equivalence class \([a]\). Now observe that \(\epsilon\) <em>is smaller than every real number embedded into the hyperreals this way.</em></p>
<p>Pick some arbitrary real number \(a\). There exists \(p \in \mathbb{N}\) such that \(\frac{1}{p}&lt; a\). There are infinitely many fractions of the form \(\frac{1}{n}\), where \(n\) is a natural number greater than \(p\), so \(\epsilon\) is smaller than \((a)\) at almost all positions, so it is smaller than \(a\).</p>
<p>This is an infinitesimal! This is a rigorously defined, coherently defined, <em>infinitesimal number</em> smaller than all real numbers! In a number system which shares all of the important properties of the real numbers! (except the Archimedean one, as we will shortly see, but that doesn't really matter).</p>
<p>Consider the following</p>
<p>\[\Omega = (1,2,3, \ldots).\]</p>
<p>By a similar argument this is larger than all possible real numbers. I encourage you to try to prove this for yourself!</p>
<p>(The Archimedean principle is that which guarantees that if you have any two real numbers, you can multiply the smaller by some natural number to become greater than the other. This is not true in the hyperreals. Why? (Hint: \(\Omega\) breaks this if you consider a real number.))</p>
<h2 id="how-does-this-tie-into-calculus-exactly">How does this tie into calculus, exactly?<a class="zola-anchor" href="#how-does-this-tie-into-calculus-exactly" aria-label="Anchor link for: how-does-this-tie-into-calculus-exactly">🔗</a></h2>
<p>Well, we have a coherent way of defining infinitesimals!</p>
<p>The short answer is that we can define the <em>star</em> operator (also called the <em>standard part</em> operator) \(\text{st}(x)\) as that which maps any hyperreal to its closest real counterpart. Then, the definition of a derivative becomes </p>
<p>\[f'(x) = \text{st}\left( \frac{^*f(x+\Delta x)- ^*f(x)}{\Delta x}\right)\]</p>
<p> where \(\Delta x\) is some infinitesimal, and \(^*f\) is the natural extension of \(f\) to the hyperreals. More on this in a future blog post!</p>
<p>It also turns out the hyperreals have a bunch of really cool applications in fields far removed from analysis. Check out my expository paper on <a href="https://ykumar.org/files/Nonstandard_Methods_and_Applications_in_Ramsey_Theory.pdf">the intersection of nonstandard analysis and Ramsey theory</a> for an example!</p>
<p>Yet, the biggest effect I think this will have is pedadogical. I've always found the definition of a limit kind of unintuitive, and it was specifically invented to add <em>post hoc</em> coherence to calculus after it had been invented and used widely. I suspect that formulating calculus via infinitesimals in introductory calculus classes would go a long way to making it more intuitive.</p>
